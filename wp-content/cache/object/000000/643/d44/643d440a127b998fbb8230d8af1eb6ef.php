go visit. I'd never been to Japan before, and had always wanted to see what it was like. In almost a snap decision, I put myself
considerably further in debt to go and find out what Japan was all about.

The trip wasn't very long, lasting between 24 April 2003 and 6 May 2003, but was worth every penny. I just wish I'd had longer
to explore. I barely scratched the surface, and mostly saw only Tokyo. (Not that I'm complaining in any way!)
