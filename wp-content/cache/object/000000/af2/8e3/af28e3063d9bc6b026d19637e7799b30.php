It's been a long time since I was last there, and it was good to see my family one last time before it expands again by one.

I really need to get out there more often.

<!--more-->Aside from the additional sleep (the beds are comfy, and there's no distractions -- except for stomping toddlers, and flushing toilets), it's good to get away from cities to remember what it's like to be "away from it all".

The cottage country mentality in Ontario is a tough one to understand if you've never lived there. Everyone wants to get away from Toronto on a regular basis. For some, it's just living outside of Toronto. For others, it's getting away from the Golden Horseshoe, to experience something unique and different.

About three hours is your limit for effectiveness. Less than that, and you're not far enough away. Toronto extends (almost) from its shores on Lake Ontario all the way to Barrie. If you can't pass Barrie, you're at risk of being a subdivision. Everything else needs to be further.

That puts you in the Muskokas. That's three hours (ish) away. It's a long haul, without being truly annoying. Well, if you're on your own, anyway. With bawling toddler, that might be another issue. For me, no biggie.

Besides, I got to be with my family. I don't see them nearly enough, and being with Cathy, Mom, Craig, and Tori was a great time. I wished Alex could have been with us, but Alex isn't really in a state to fly that far -- it's a tough slog when you're 35 weeks pregnant. Heck, it's almost a tough slog for me!

It's almost time for me to head back to Alberta, but I thought I'd toss in a few pictures of the weekend just past...
