The heating pipes are now ready. At least the inspectors says so. The heat is a long way from being done, but a least a bit of it is good to go.

The inspector left the papers behind, including a note about how final approval will require heating restored to the upstairs. That's also part of the renovations -- we need an air exchanger.

<!--more-->Mind you, there are issues with the piping I still need to have addressed, notably:
<ul>
	<li>A roughed line for a future expansion in the basement</li>
	<li>A patch that seems to be devoid of piping for some reason</li>
</ul>
I'm told those will be dealt with before the concrete arrives. Let's hope so...
