Provincial. New MLAs, new premier (in theory), all that jazz. In most provinces, it's usually time of actual change -- old regimes are voted out, new ones come to power, more scandals (from different angles), and (this is the important part) an opposition party that actually has some teeth.

But this is Alberta. Nothing ever changes in Alberta. The PCs being in an overwhelming majority is like the sun coming up in the morning.

<!--more-->Alberta is the most conservative province in Canada. That's not an opinion, that's fact. This is a province that barely tolerates anything considered "out of the norm". Even in the major cities (notably Calgary and Edmonton), where the non-PC parties gain most of their support, the vast majority still vote conservative.

Which is why we have exactly the same government we had two days ago. It hasn't changed. The names might change, but the thing still works the same. Ed Stelmach loved to talk about how there was a mandate from the people and how this is a reassurance of support.

Somehow, I doubt 40% is all that reassuring a number there, Ed. Seems to me that most people believed that little would change, and frankly didn't see any significant reason to vote otherwise.

A point of note to the Liberals, the NDP, the Green Party, and whoever else wants to run against the PCs in this province:

<strong>PICK A FREAKING PLATFORM, AND STATE IT CLEARLY.</strong>

Merely stating that you think the PCs are dumb and their ideas aren't good is about as effective as saying: "I know you are, but what am I?"

Take a lesson from our neighbours to the south: Get in tight spots. Shoot your mouth off. Create controversy. Raise a stink. But for the love of all things political do <em>SOMETHING </em>than just stand there.

At least it would make the election more than a passing footnote...";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"There was an election?";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"there-was-an-election";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2009-08-20 16:51:29";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2009-08-20 22:51:29";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:55:"http://www.sowrey.org/2008/03/04/there-was-an-election/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"5";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
