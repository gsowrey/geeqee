We're officially out of the "long vacation" timeframe, and into the "standard" two week vacation timeframe. You know this one: enough time to fly to a distant land, see two or three different places, get really drunk in a bar and get robbed blind, realise you've actually got a funky disease you're not sure if you got from the food or that person you swore looked like a woman the night before...

What? Why are you looking at me like that? You make it sound like no-one else has vacations like that.

<!--more-->Anyway, we're running out of time, and it still feels like there's a tonne to do. Our list now looks like this:
<ul>
	<li>Cancel our CableTica service</li>
	<li>Sell our car (currently trying, and having no luck at all)</li>
	<li>"Cancel" our phone (aka give it back to the company)</li>
	<li>Pack up the stuff we're taking with us on the plane</li>
	<li>Have the rest of our stuff packed and shipped by slow banana boat (and I'm not really kidding about that -- it probably is a banana boat)</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Arrange for our utilities in Calgary (gas, electricity, water)</span></li>
	<li>Get our cell phones working in Calgary (probably can't do that until we get there)</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Organise the times/dates for moving our stuff out of storage and back into our house</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Arrange for plane tickets</span></li>
	<li>Arrange for hotels for moving (we have to stay at least one night in CR and one night in Calgary), and it they have to take cats</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Get a rental car</span></li>
	<li>Then buy a car in Calgary</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Figure out how to get what money we've managed to save up north so we don't try carrying it across the border (read: bad idea)</span></li>
	<li>Arrange for documentation to prove that we can take our daughter out of Costa Rica (no, I'm not kidding -- Temporary Residents need this for some bizarre reason, even if both parents are present)</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Make sure we can get our cat back into Canada (read: find all the documentation we had from 18 months ago)</span></li>
	<li>Clean our apartment top-to-bottom</li>
	<li>Give away what we're not taking back to friends (and other organisations)</li>
	<li>Say "goodbye" to the people we've come to know very well over the last year and a half (this is going to truly suck)</li>
	<li>Make sure we have clothes that are cold-weather appropriate (at least until all of our other clothing is out of storage)</li>
</ul>
Maybe 50% of the list is done/covered. And there's a few really big items that still worry me a lot. Like the car. I really REALLY want to sell that car. It's an asset I don't want lying around. I've got backup plans, if necessary, but having it dispensed with would REALLY help.
