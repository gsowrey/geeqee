But when Chris told me that he was going to get married, the last thing I could do was miss the blessed event (see <a href="/photos/wedding/chris-and-kazumi/">Chris and Kaz's Wedding</a>).

The trip ran from 25 March 2004 (departure from Canada) to 10 April 2004. This is a selection of images with captions -- the rest of the photos that I've posted appear in the journal entries for those dates.
