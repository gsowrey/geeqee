Three weeks away from Alex and Mi Peque√±a Ni√±a. Each day has been a challenge being so far away from them. The longest I'd ever been away before was six days. Six short days. That was hard -- I missed them both a lot, and that was just after spending over two weeks with them every waking moment.

My well, you could say, has run dry. I have nothing left in my reserves. I want to go home now. I want to be with them both right now. If I could just get on a plane and go there this afternoon, I would.

But I have to wait another week.

<!--more-->I'd be dead without Skype. Until yesterday, we had no working phone with which to call North America. None. So calling home would have been impossible. Renting a cell phone is possible, but the cost of use is akin to certain sexual practises that are considered illegal under most western laws. Skype -- Video Skype, to be specific -- has allowed me to keep in touch with my darlings. I'd be lost without it. But even then, it's been almost a month and Mi Peque√±a Ni√±a has grown and developed a lot in that time. She pulls herself up to standing in her crib. She holds her bottle. She eats a lot better with her hands.

And I'm not there.

I travel back in a week to finish the packing and moving jobs. Then it's final -- my family and I are out of Calgary. I'll be so happy to be with them again. It seems like forever.

I'm so not cut out to be a bachelor anymore...";s:10:"post_title";s:14:"One week to go";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:14:"one-week-to-go";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2008-07-08 15:07:30";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2008-07-08 21:07:30";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://www.sowrey.org/?p=1018";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"5";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
