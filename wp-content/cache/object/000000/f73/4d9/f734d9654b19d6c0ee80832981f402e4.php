It's known as the "Garden Island", and for good reason. It's mostly forested (also handily being the wettest place on Earth) and not completely overrun by humans. Parts of the island are almost inaccessible ... even by the ubiquitous jungle chickens that roam pretty much anywhere they darned well want. It's a beautiful little place, if perhaps a little rough around the edges in a few spots.
