In a (very short) word, I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek">geek</a>. Not the carnival performing variety (I prefer my chickens pre-cooked, thank you) -- the techno-obessive, shiny-object-following, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/trains/">train-chasing</a> type.

I'm also a technical geek, which is how I make a living. The short version is I make websites. (The long version is pretty much almost an entire blog onto itself.) I have <a href="http://www.geeqee.ca/">a little one-man operation</a> that pays the bills.

I've used computers since the late 1970s (Snoopy vs. The Red Baron, a math game, on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>). The first computer I had was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC">IBM PC 5150</a> in 1982. I taught myself BASIC. I learned HTML from <a href="http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~nrandall/">my English Rhetoric professor</a>. And yes, I have a Mac.

I've worked on the internet since early 1992. That means I've been around long enough to know the web before the graphical browser, back when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Information_Servers">WAIS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_(computer)">Veronica</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine">Archie</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USENET">Usenet</a> reigned supreme. I know exactly what's happening behind the scenes when you type in "www.google.com" into your browser, and how the page appears.

I've seen the rise of the web from almost its infancy into the single most powerful communication and commerce tool since Gutenburg's days. No, I don't consider that hyperbole -- I believe it with every gram of my soul.

Lest ye think I'm "one of those" who are rabid about the internet, that belief still comes with a substantial amount of feet-firmly-planted-on-ground. I don't believe in technology for technology's sake. I believe in function leading form, and that creative design is not only required but should be taken more seriously than "just make it look good".

I'm a writer. I'm an architect. I'm a photographer. I'm a father. I'm an explorer. I'm a technologist. I'm only as old as I act. I read non-fiction and enjoy it. I watch movies and enjoy their deconstruction. I listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstones.com/">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="http://www.corblund.com/">Corb Lund</a>, <a href="http://www.milesdavis.com/">Miles Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tokyoskanet">Tokyo Ska Paradise</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(band)">Ministry</a>, <a href="http://www.beastieboys.com/">Beastie Boys</a>, <a href="http://www.thehip.com/">The Tragically Hip</a>, <a href="http://www.kylie.com/">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href="http://www.daftpunk.com/">Daft Punk</a>, <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a>, and <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/">Weird Al Yankovic</a>. I know the meanings of "art", "silence", and "think". And I get a kick out of surprising people.
