I hate them because they're meant to summarize the potential of an applicant into as few words as possible. This is to help interviewers save time, by weeding out the possible from the improbable. I know this because I've been the one doing the weeding for many years. Resumes are but a mere glimpse, and you often don't get a sense of a person until you actually meet them.

The best I can do with this "resume" is hope to give you that glimpse. But, with apologies, I will not be brief. I have much to offer...

I am a person of many hats: I've been a head of department, a sole proprietor, a development standards "authority" (and believe me when I say I use that term loosely), a code monkey, a business analyst, a data analyst, a technology architect, a systems administrator, a team leader, a mentor, a student, theÂ MacGuyver, the Winston Wolfe, the writer, the Devil's Advocate, and a dreamer. And sometimes, all in the same day.

If you were to ask me to summarize my skills into a single phrase (which, yes, I've been asked on many occasions), I describe myself best as a "technical communicator": I bridge the gap between the needs of a project and the execution of those needs. I help recognise goals, milestones, and challenges, and then work with the team (client, creative, project management, and technology, alike) to achieve them. My success comes from the team's success.

I believe all titles come with responsibility, that there is honour in accountability, and that failure is an option if you're willing to take a risk. I know that it is possible to work smarter, but nothing comes without the sweat of hard work. I believe in the goal, and that the path to the goal sometimes means challenge and discovery. A job is only as interesting as one chooses to make it.
<h2>Talents</h2>
A talent is something inherent to a person. It starts out raw, but through time and practice can grow to a powerful asset. I may not be an illustrator, but my work is still creative.
<ul>
	<li>Technical documentation such as manuals, requirements documentation, process documentation (including diagrams)</li>
	<li>System architecture, providing specifications from inputs to outputs and all points in-between</li>
	<li>Simplifying processes while ensuring accountability, reproducibility, and reliability</li>
	<li>Finding simple solutions to unorthodox problems</li>
	<li>Rendering inherently technical information into audience-specific language</li>
	<li>Leading teams into difficult projects, giving them the confidence to excel</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experience</h2>
I believe that jobs should be interesting. I've had a number of interesting jobs, where I have learned not only employable skills, but also how to work well with employees.

I also offer a handy (and much more appealing) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/3435809422/" target="_blank">graphical version of this resume</a>:
