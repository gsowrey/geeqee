It's actually smaller than our current house, but should allow for a little more flexibility, and easier for us to content with the arrival of our firstborn in a few months (see [[Be Afraid. Very Afraid.]]).

Yesterday was the close on our "new" house. (We had a conditional sale on our current house on Thursday.) We didn't actually get into it until today. The previous owner asked for a little leeway as it was taking longer to move than he'd planned. We were in no rush, so what the hey...

<!--more-->The house was in surprisingly good shape. Overall, I was very impressed with the manner in which the house was left. My last two homes were bits of surprises when I came to find garbage everywhere. Our current house even had a sectional couch left in the basement.

Although, I should point out that the previous owner did leave behind his pool table. Yes, pool table. A big one. Who the heck leaves behind a POOL TABLE? (BTW - Anyone want it? It's free for the taking, but you gotta come and get it.)

We went in to take pictures, tour the house and remember what we liked and what we're going to change. And we're going to change a lot. Especially in the basement. As you can see, I've added a new category -- Renovations -- because this is gonna be a long-lasting thread, folks. This house is going to have a lot done to it.

To kick things off, I'm providing the "starting" state in pictures. See what's here. Because when we're done, this won't look anything the same (I hope). Wish us luck...
