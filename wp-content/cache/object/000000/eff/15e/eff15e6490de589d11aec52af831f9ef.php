We're keeping it light, mostly because there's a lot of concern that we might not be able to carry this baby to term. It's Alex's first pregnancy, and we know a lot of people who've had trouble. There's no reason we should have a cakewalk of this.

So far, the full list of those in the know include:
<ul>
	<li>Colette (one of Alex's coworkers)
She kind of figured it out on her own after Alex had a total pregnant-brain moment.</li>
	<li>Cathy and Craig
We told Cathy because were trying to get Mom and Janice on the phone at the same time (three-way calling) and needed Cathy's coordinating help.</li>
	<li>Tamara (and Dan, by association)
I told Tamara because I need her help making a video to tell everyone else when the time is right. (And frankly, I thought she could use some good news for a change.) I freely admit that I suck at these tools, and she can do them a lot better than I. She just about cried (I told her at the reception yesterday) and squeezed the heck out of me.</li>
	<li>Allen and Jean
We had a belated Christmas with them yesterday, and the last present to them was a card with a copy of the ultrasound. Jean was beyond excited. I've never heard Allen that animated. I can tell that they're both eager to be grandparents.</li>
	<li>Mom and Janice
They found at the same moment, once we managed to get them both on the phone (through three-way calling) at the same time. Mom's already a grandmother, so this wasn't a terrible shock to her; Janice was definitely pleased with the news.</li>
</ul>
So why haven't we told anyone else? We're mostly concerned about the chance of losing the baby. That'll be hard on Alex when people ask: "So how's the baby doing?" Once we're past either the first prenatal exam on the 25th (if Alex is feeling positive enough about it) or the official three-month mark, we'll tell the world, of course.
