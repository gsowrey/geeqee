Mostly because we'd been told by several Brits and Aussies that we could expect a plethora of unsanitary toilets, pushy and obnoxious people, and horrible trains.

I really have to wonder what on Earth these people saw that was so bad?

So far, we've had excellent experiences, even walking into alleyways that are likely more local than tourist. The bathrooms have been clean (mostly, some do have a fairly powerful odour), the food has been mostly outstanding, the people very friendly ("art students" aside, we've had a number of people who do just want to talk, even if Amy doesn't dig the whole "practise my English" thing), and the pushy lines are no worse than trying to get into Future Shop on Boxing Day.
