I then started a new life.

Last year, I spent a month living in a city that I'd only been to three times before. I had two things in my favour: 1) I was living with family (my Aunt, Uncle, and cousin), and 2) I had time to myself to think, contemplate, and rebuild.

It's been 12 months since I arrived here. I look back at what I used to be, who I used to be, and I'm pleased that I bid farewell to that person ... to that life. It was a dead-end for me, one of mental hardship and emotional strife. It's something no-one should have to experience willingly.

But I would be lying if I said I got here alone. Very few things can be done in life without help from others, and rarely does that help come without request. I had lots of help and support. From Joel, who helped me pack up my belongings; from Greg, who not only packed, but help me drive to Calgary; from my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, and cousin Jen, who made me feel welcome in their home and provided me with the shelter I needed to restart; from all of my friends, near and far, who supported me in my decision; from my family, whose concern kept me going; and most of all from my sister Cathy, who became my pillar of strength in my hour of greatest need.

Basically, if you're reading this, you have contributed, even in some small way, to who I am. Even if all you did was send me an email joke, it was enough to brighten a day. To all of you, I say "Thanks".

I suppose I should go out and celebrate, rejoice in the freedom and happiness I enjoy. But it wouldn't change much -- I celebrate each and every moment, each and every friend and family member.

May the years to come bring you as much happiness.";s:10:"post_title";s:42:"Remembering a Year Since Leaving Vancouver";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:28:"year-since-leaving-vancouver";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2001-03-01 13:31:03";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2001-03-01 19:31:03";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:61:"http://www.sowrey.org/index.php/year-since-leaving-vancouver/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
