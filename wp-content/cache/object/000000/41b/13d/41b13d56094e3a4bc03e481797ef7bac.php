We have a place to live. That's important, because it's a place to go to. That would make this move even harder. But let's not mistake one key detail:

There's only two weeks left (10 business days, at that). And I've got a lot to do.

Among them:
<ul>
	<li>Sell my car (and other things -- a post for that is coming soon!)</li>
	<li>Arrange for property management (almost done)</li>
	<li>Ensure financials are sorted out (notably the bank accounts, and get a wire transfer to Costa Rica for our place)</li>
	<li>Get my working visa sorted out</li>
	<li>Meet with the tax guy up here (and he hasn't set a meeting yet)</li>
	<li>Ensure the renovations will be finished (they're nowhere near done)</li>
	<li>Make sure the movers are arranged (as they'll need to clean the house out when I come back for Alex and the Wee One, herein known as Mi PequeÃ±a NiÃ±a, or MPN for short)</li>
	<li>and probably a million other things I can't think of right now</li>
</ul>
Needless to say, I've got a lot on my plate. There's a lot to do, and not much time to do it.
