Strangely fitting that our last train would be to our first plane in quite some time.

Chek Lap Kok airport was designed with an express train in mind, which is great considering how far out the airport is from Hong Kong Island. The train system (the Aiport Express) also lets you check in at the train station, so you don't have to check in at the airport.

At the airport, we did a last bit of souvenir shopping. Well, Amy did, anyway. We then headed out to Gate 63 for our flight to Japan. It seemed strangely final. This was our first plane since landing in St. Petersburg all that time ago. Amy flew Biz class (as you already know), and I flew in Galley Slave (aka Economy) class. Lest anyone think I resent Amy for this, I don't. We flew to Russia on Amy's points. She had some leftover on United Airlines, and upgraded to Business Class. All the power to her.

Doesn't mean that I'm not gonna bug her about it, though. I gotta have fun with this, don't I?

For the record, I ended up with about as much footroom as Amy, if not a bit more, because I asked for an exit row. You want to have a good long flight? Get an exit row -- you'll be able to stretch out without concern. Doesn't matter if the row is full and others are not -- you'll have tonnes of room to spare.

Two flights left.
