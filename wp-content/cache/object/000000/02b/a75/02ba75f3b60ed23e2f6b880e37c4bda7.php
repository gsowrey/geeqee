Primarily, it's Rolex. But for reasons I think are due only to administration (I don't touch it at all), we also kind of have one of Critical Mass's newest clients -- Big Rock Brewery.

(I can't tell you how happy we were to find that Big Rock was a client. Mmmm. Beer.)

To celebrate the work we've done on one client, we all went to the other for fun. And beer tasting.

Mmmm. Beer.
