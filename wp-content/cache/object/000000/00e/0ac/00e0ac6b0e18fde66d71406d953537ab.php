This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father's death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office. Not really getting a life, but it's a start.

Wow. That's a lot of stuff. The really scary part is that is only a tiny portion of what went on this year. If you missed anything, they're all posted on my website.

Resolutions for this year? Be happier. Last year was hard. That's not to say that this year will be any easier, but happy people live longer and have more fun. Goodness knows I've got a lot to be happy about.";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"2002, A Year in Review";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:19:"2002-year-in-review";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2009-12-22 15:28:20";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2009-12-22 21:28:20";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:65:"http://www.sowrey.org/index.php/2003/01/01/2000-year-in-review-2/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
