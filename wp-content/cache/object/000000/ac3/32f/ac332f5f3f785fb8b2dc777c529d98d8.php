On behalf of my co-workers,<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/web-20-expo/"> I blogged notes from the event</a> to make sure that they had the benefit of getting the information in as much detail as could be effectively provided. (Of course, Scott Schiller out-did me on the day he was there, and recorded the audio on his MiniDisc system. But I digress.)

My major issue was the blogging. It's tough to write down the notes, and ensure that they all get posted properly. WordPress lost connection at one point and I lost my notes. I was peeved, to say the least. Ideally, it would be blog each point as it came up. But that looks dumb in <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. And I knew of no other tool that did it well.

Until now...

<!--more-->Thanks to the <a href="http://twitter.com/">TwitterSphere</a> (believe it or not), I found out about a tool called <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com/">ScribbleLive</a>. I got a chance to play around with it a bit this morning, and found it not only lightweight, but now I'm just ITCHING for a chance to put it to good use.

Then -- skin me alive and call me "luggage" -- I found out that I know one of the guys who developed it. <a href="http://www.keebler.net/">Jonathan Keebler</a> and co-worker Michael De Monte with CTV (former with MUCH Interactive before the much-wept purchase of CHUM) banged it together in their spare time. And in true Web 2.0 form, it's lightweight, simple, easy-to-use, and makes good use of other services such as OpenID to manage logins.

<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/22/scribblelive-two-guys-in-canada-launch-sweet-liveblogging-platform/">TechCrunch found out about them</a>, too. Not a bad way to start a new business model. ;)
