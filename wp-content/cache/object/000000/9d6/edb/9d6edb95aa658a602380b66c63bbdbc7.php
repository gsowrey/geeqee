It can be for any number of reasons. But there's one guy out there who looks for the dirty jobs. The ones that no-one really wants to do, but does anyway. The ones where if the job wasn't done, the world would (in many cases) come to a halt. They're dangerous, often nauseating, and usually done by people far more interesting than we'd ever believe.

That's what <a href="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</a>'s <em><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/dirtyjobs.html">Dirty Jobs</a></em> is all about. If you haven't watched it, <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/video/index.html?playerId=203711706&amp;categoryId=210013706&amp;lineupId=935463420">you really should check it out</a>. It's one of the few decent things on television, and one of only three shows that I'll go out of my way to watch (the other two being Dirty Jobs' sibling, <em><a href="dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html">Mythbusters</a></em>, and <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/pushingdaisies/">ABC's <em>Pushing Daisies</em></a>).

But there's something about Dirty Jobs' host, <a href="dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/bio/bio.html">Mike Rowe</a>, and the way he handles the content of the show, that really adds another layer. Namely, poo.

<!--more-->If you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about. And to that end, you might have thought the same thing Alex thought of: there really needs to be a drinking game behind all this. So we bring you our version of the Dirty Jobs Drinking Game. (There is <a href="http://kwc.org/blog/archives/2006/2006-09-07.dirty_jobs_drinking_game.html">one other I know of</a>, but I wanted to add some complication to it -- what's the point of having a drinking game if it's easy to do?)
<h4>The Rules</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Something alcoholic is preferred, but you can go with pop (soda) or chocolate milk if you have to. Otherwise, it's just not as funny.</li>
	<li>No pausing the show to drink. If things come fast and furious, you need to keep up. So keep a good stock of liquids at the ready.</li>
	<li>Don't pre-watch the episode. That's just taking the fun out of it. Repeats are fine, since few have actually memorised anything. (And after running through this, you'll likely want to forget it anyway.)</li>
	<li>If you're the last one standing, you've got a Dirty Job of your own. But don't call Mike -- I'm pretty sure he'll pass.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Drinking Definitions</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Drink - a sip of wine or hard alcohol, swig of beer</li>
	<li>Shot - 1/3 glass of wine, shot glass of hard alcohol, 8 oz beer (technically over 1/2 a North American bottle, but 1/2 will do for ease-of-comparison)</li>
	<li>Chug - a glass of wine, 3 shots of hard alcohol, a complete beer (yes, this seems somewhat lighter on the beer crowd, but that carbonation does pack a wallop)</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Conditions</h4>
This is broken down not just by amount to drink, but by what's said/going on. You'll understand why after your third beer...

<h4>And Finally</h4>
Because poo seems to play such a large part of things that happens on Dirty Jobs, any time the word "poo" is mentioned (especially by Mike), not only follow the conditions above, but you must also yell "POO"!";s:10:"post_title";s:28:"The Dirty Jobs Drinking Game";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:28:"the-dirty-jobs-drinking-game";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2009-08-21 11:36:07";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2009-08-21 17:36:07";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://www.sowrey.org/2007/12/06/the-dirty-jobs-drinking-game/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
