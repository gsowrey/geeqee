<p class="p1">â€œReally. How did SAHQ find out about Dunley?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œI donâ€™t know, it wasnâ€™t through me. You know I didnâ€™t say anything!â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œI didnâ€™t suggestâ€”â€œ</p>
<p class="p1">â€œIâ€™ve seen every transmission, too, and that wasnâ€™t one of them.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œSend in a cancel for the transfer. Tell them there was a mistake, and everythingâ€™s fine.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œI tried. The new administratorâ€™s already on the next the transport, and the transport isnâ€™t responding.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œThe <i>next </i>transport? Interesting. The transportâ€™s due soon, if Iâ€™m not mistaken. When did SAHQ issue the transfer?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œI canâ€™t tell for sure, but I think it was was only three days ago.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œThree days? Dunleyâ€™s replacement must have been nearby. How soon until the transport arrives?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œTwenty hours, according to the schedule.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œHmm. What do you know of our new addition?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œIâ€™m still going into the records. Hereâ€™s the short version: Thirty-seven, divorced, one child. Engineering background, but hasnâ€™t really done any actual engineering work in the last decade. Assignments have been short, menial mid-level, arranged through Commodore Perezâ€™s office for the last decade. Prior to that, two years with the Constabulary on Earth, during the Sao PaÃµlo Riots. No commendations, no awards. Thereâ€™s a note of a court martial, which was dropped.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œAnother washout, perhapsâ€¦â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œShould I alter the records?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œNo, thereâ€™s no value in that. Weâ€™ll have to deal with the complication. Anything you do will be undone in conversation, and could raise suspicion.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œDo you think thereâ€™ll be trouble?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œItâ€™s possible. Any new face will require questions, questions require answers, and answers can spark action. If weâ€™re lucky, the answers will be routine, and not interfere with our efforts. Weâ€™re too close for a minor thing like a crew change to get in our way. Our last supplies should be on this transport. Just keep things simple and no-one will be the wiser know until weâ€™re ready. Who knows, this may even work to our advantage!â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œIf thereâ€™s an investigation into Dunley, there might be some awkward questions.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œGood. And weâ€™ll answer them. Better that no-one suspects a deception.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œIâ€™ll make sure Dunleyâ€™s quarters are scrubbed clean, just in case.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œA wise thought. Iâ€™d hate for our new guest to find an unkempt home.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œIs there anything else we should do?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œWatch and learn any habits.â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œAnd fears?â€</p>
<p class="p1">â€œEspecially fears.â€</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:38:"The Shepherd's Path: Wonder, Chapter 2";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:35:"the-shepherds-path-wonder-chapter-2";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-10-21 09:28:49";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-10-21 15:28:49";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:3508;s:4:"guid";s:35:"http://www.sowrey.org/?page_id=3511";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
