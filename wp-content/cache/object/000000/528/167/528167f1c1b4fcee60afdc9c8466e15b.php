Not so much for ego (though there is no question that ego is an element of the desire), but also out of plain ol' curiousity -- how are people finding all the crap I keep here, anyway?

Today, I came across a hit from <a href="http://damngoodmanager.com/">Damn Good Manager</a>. With a name like that, I had to check it out.

<!--more-->Turns out Damn Good Manager was built and is maintained by a friend of mine, <a href="http://fuzzz.gaulin.ca/">Andre</a>. (I ran into him during a conference earlier in the year.) Andre and I have similar jobs -- leading a group of developers. We're managers. And let's be honest, it's not always an easy job.

Andre's created a rather interesting site that includes a wad of information that seem obvious, but aren't always top-of-mind when you're in the middle of a slog. Two particularly interesting articles that I intend to send out to others are <a href="http://damngoodmanager.com/2007/11/08/managing-a-managers-time/">Managing a Manager's Time</a> and <a href="http://damngoodmanager.com/2007/11/06/7-habits-of-damn-good-managers/">7 Habits of Damn Good Managers</a>.

And I think I'm gonna send the link out to all the technology managers here, too.";s:10:"post_title";s:17:"Damn Good Manager";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:17:"damn-good-manager";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:133:"http://damngoodmanager.com/2007/11/08/managing-a-managers-time/
