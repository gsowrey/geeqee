This year, the Town Hall had a late night talk show theme, which gave way to some really bizarre behaviour. Follow that with heavy drinking and then a jaunt outside the city, you get quite a treat of content. There was so much, that I had to whittle it down to just this.

By the way, I cannot take credit/blame for all these pictures. First, I had two cameras, one of which was used by Reid on the golf course. Second, I was very, very drunk after the Town Hall.
