Met up with Jim at the Expo hall, about 20 minutes before they closed the floor. (What's with closing the Expo hall at 4, anyway?) Skipped the keynote.

<!--more-->Went to the Thirsty Bear, a local brew pub where we met up with two of Jim's co-workers. Went through a few interesting beverages before going on the "crawl". Although Yahoo!'s Brickhouse is supposed to be #10 on an 11-location tour, that was our sole destination.

Schill was spinning for the first little bit. Hunted down Judemat. Met up with Sunni. Been a long time since seeing either of them. Many long chats with them, as well with a couple of ex-pats. Ducked out 'round 9:30. Getting too old for this shit.

Venue #11 was closed before I left the Brickhouse. Pathetic.
