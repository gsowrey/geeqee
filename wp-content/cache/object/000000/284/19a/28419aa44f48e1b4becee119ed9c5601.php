Really. Yes, I complain about when things seem to drag out far longer than they should, or if I'm busting my arse far harder than I think I should. That's part of being human, no? In the end, though, I like long years because I get to look back and not worry about how quickly time has flown by. Time should never fly by quickly -- it means I've missed something, and ... well, darn it, I just hate missing things!

This last year was a big one for me in one major way: it was a redefinition of my professional existence. Since the end of 2009, I've transformed from a professional manager to a ... hmm ... well, my title (however formal it needs to be) is "Solutions Lead", but that belies a lot of what I do every day, and just using "web developer" or "programmer" -- even with a "Senior" prefix -- completely understates the reality. This year was really about taking all the skills and knowledge I'd acquired as a leader, and merging that back into my day-to-day development practices.

And that, as the saying goes, was only the tip of the iceberg...

<!--more-->I did a LOT of work. I did so much, in fact, that my contracting business is gone. Doors closed, windows shut, lights off. Permanently. I had to make a very painful call to realise that I need to focus on the three most important things in my life: my family. (There's three of them, in case you were wondering.) To focus on them means to remove all other distractions inasmuch as is possible, and still earn a paycheque along the way (helping to support said family, of course).

Add to that Alex's return to work after nearly four years off as a Professional Mom, working evening shifts. That meant more time as a Professional Dad, whether I liked it or not. (And I like it, really. Except for dinner time. Suddenly, I have nothing but sympathy for my parents when I was a kid.) It's adjustment, it's growth.

As a result of all of this, many things suffered. My hobbies (what few I have) were shelved -- even my desire to blog waned dramatically, with more than a couple of blogless months. My TV watching fell to an all-time low, and I can count on one hand the number of movies I saw in the theatre (coincidentally, also the number of movies I watched during the Christmas break at home through iTunes). My health has also been ... unattended, with a noticeable increase in girth and an unhealthy increase in my beer consumption (since decreased, thankfully).

But if you were to ask me if I was "unhappy", I'd have to say "no". Every day, my kids remind me why I'm proud to be their dad. Every day, I get a challenge in my job. Every day, I enjoy life, even if it's only for a few moments. To say I'm "unhappy" would be a disservice (if not an outright insult) to my daily existence, and those around me.

To that end, I can safety state that I've:
<ul>
	<li>Been into Banff National Park on a few occasions -- both warm and cold -- but nowhere near enough for my liking</li>
	<li>Picnicked as much as we could, but again nowhere near enough for what we could have done</li>
	<li>Enjoyed the first brew from Calgary's new Village Brewery</li>
	<li>Did some renovation work in the kitchen (and planned more renovation work for this year)</li>
	<li>Retaught myself the fundamentals of being a (web) developer, and merged that with the skills and knowledge of a technology director</li>
	<li>Lamented as I saw Choo Choo seem to grow by leaps and bounds, going from my little baby girl to a walking, talking toddler</li>
	<li>Finally accepted the truth, and got glasses</li>
	<li>Came to understand my father in ways I never thought possible, and really wished that he could be here today to see how his son (kinda) grew up</li>
	<li>Accepted the reality that I will only ever be a father of two beautiful girls -- there will never be a third offspring</li>
	<li>Watched in horror as Canada succumbed to fear mongering and elected a government that refuses to listen to its own people (a terrifyingly global trend in 2011)</li>
	<li>Mourned the loss of one of Canada's best politicians since Pierre Trudeau, the Honourable Jack Layton</li>
	<li>Experienced my first general anesthesia to get my hernia repaired ... boy, I do <em>not</em> want to go through that again!</li>
	<li>Drank way too much coffee (yes, folks, that is possible)</li>
	<li>Similarly, also drank too much beer (yes, also possible, though admittedly it tasted really good at the time)</li>
	<li>Launched more projects in one year than I had launched during my busiest five years (combined) at my previous company</li>
	<li>Took Monkey on the SUPER SECRET MONKEY SURPRISE -- a short trip on CP 2816</li>
	<li>Took Monkey to the Stampede, and realised to my delight (or possible horror, not sure yet) that she loves rides, especially roller coasters</li>
	<li>Also got the Mother of All Headaches while at the Stampede...</li>
	<li>Travelled to Ontario to visit with my family</li>
	<li>Spent a lot of time swimming in the lake with Monkey and my nieces</li>
	<li>Rode another steam train in Huntsville</li>
	<li>Visited with some old and dear friends (especially Stuart and Therese)</li>
	<li>Celebrated Monkey's 4th birthday, and Choo Choo's first birthday</li>
	<li>Also rode on the Heritage Park steam train</li>
	<li>Travelled to Red Deer to see the Backyardigans live (oh, the things parents must do...)</li>
	<li>Travelled once again to the West Coast for post-Christmas and New Year's celebrations</li>
</ul>
I'm sure there's other stuff I did, but my blog was so light on content in 2011 that ... well, I'm not sure. Sure, I can try to read Twitter, but I used that in lieu of my blog, so there's a few thousand tweets I'd need to go over. That's a little too much. So if I'm making any resolution this year, it's to write more blog posts.";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"2011, A Year In Review";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"2011-a-year-in-review";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-05-27 20:34:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-05-28 02:34:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://www.sowrey.org/?p=2980";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
