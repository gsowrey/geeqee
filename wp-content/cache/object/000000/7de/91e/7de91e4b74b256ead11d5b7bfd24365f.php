Antics is putting it lightly. Here's the short version ('cuz I really don't feel like typing it all out): 

<ol>
<li>had to work saturday to finish performance management reviews; god I hate
writing them</li>
<li>went to jim's birthday party at mountain view bowlerama; alex couldn't
come because of a migraine</li>
<li>went to jim and mia's place afterwards for chatting</li>
<li>didn't end up going to milestone's for kristen's birthday (turns out she
wasn't there, anyway), and went to check on alex</li>
<li>went to the gym</li>
<li>had a severe craving for dim sum, so called everyone around 10:30 and
woke them up; tamara, dan, jensenne, fritz, and jin; adrian bailed, didn't
have doug's number</li>
<li>bought a scanner -- can finally get some more photos in my site!</li>
<li>made chicken stew in breadbowls for dinner for alex and i -- couldn't
even finish them; totally stuffed</li>
</ol>
