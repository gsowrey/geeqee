It was a blissfully short stay at the hospital for Alex and baby, and now we're adjusting to the new family life.

Except for Asia. She's not really digging this loud pink thing that's stealing her thunder...

<!--more -->We left the hospital unit around 1530, first stopping by the DI unit to show off our offspring to friends. Then it off into a rainy afternoon and home.

Suddenly, our lack of a heat source in the house became a real problem. Thankfully, we have a wood-burning fireplace. That will keep the edge off for now.

Erin stopped by for a visit to meet the new one.  Not long after she arrived, I had my first unassisted diaper change. 

Wow. I knew diapers were nasty, but DANG that was ... actually, I'll spare you the details. There are some things that do not need to be on this site. And the contents of diapers, no matter how interesting, are one of them.

One down. A few thousand to go.

Asia's feeling ignored, I think. I'm trying to treat her the same as before, but she knows things have changed. Hopefully the sibling rivalry stays sane.

Hopefully Alex can get some sleep tonight. She's running on about 2 or so over the last 36 hours. I ain't too far behind ... but I didn't birth no baby, and even rockstars need their rest.
