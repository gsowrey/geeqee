I got a call from them yesterday saying they were getting started with the heat piping, and would take 1-2 days to get it all in.

I came home last night, and it was all in. Almost.

<!--more-->Okay, so things aren't exactly perfect. I think it's because my diagram might need more detail. There's a missing rough line for an expansion we're hoping to do in a couple of years. There's a lot of piping where we're going to move their stairs to (which seems a bit odd, since we don't want to put pressure there), piping missing by the existing stairs, and a little too much piping that'll appear under the future washer/dryer area.

Following up with Canyon today to see if I'm on crack, or if they accounted for all of this.
