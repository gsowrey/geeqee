I'm not sure what it is. When I was in Panama a few weeks ago, I was out happily snapping pictures when, for reasons I simply don't understand, the auto-focus stopped working.

My first thought was condensation. My camera had been inside an air-conditioned room for a day or so, and Panama is warm and humid. Bad combination for cameras, I tell you. I figured enough time to warm up and allow the condensation to leave should be enough.

It's been a few weeks. The auto-focus still doesn't work. The camera still seems to take decent pictures (manual focus is still available), but I've come to rely on the auto-focus to make sure my pictures are tack sharp.

I've checked the AF regions. I've reset all the settings. I've cleaned the pins and lens contacts (it happens with both my lenses). I've cleaned the mirror, too.

Anyone know what might be wrong? I'm outta ideas, and sending my camera to the shop to fix here in Costa Rica raises a number of language-based issues.";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"My Canon Rebel XT doesn't work";s:13:"post_category";s:1:"0";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:29:"my-canon-rebel-xt-doesnt-work";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2009-08-20 14:33:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2009-08-20 20:33:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:29:"http://www.sowrey.org/?p=1027";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"5";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
