This was as part of a big historical weekend, when Jasper officially reopened the restored Grand Trunk Railway station house. 6060 brought in the special event train, and I got to chase it the whole way (that is, when I wasn't driving the crew around or running errands). Never got to ride, but there are times when chasing is better.
