		<description><![CDATA[All 7mm laminate is junk. Half of it has been sitting in warehouses for 10 years between being sold and returned and edge waxed. Even most 8mm is junk. You have to get at least a 10mm laminate if you want a good floor. You can get good deals on 12mm at sams or your local outlet shoppe. Or even at the big box stores and lumber liquidators if you shop around and wait for sales. At your request, lumber liquidators will email you every time they have a sale. I&#039;ve been installing laminate floors since they invented them. There is no 7mm laminate that is good quality residential flooring material]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have laid laminate twice. First time absolutely no problem. Second time, nothing but trouble. IN THE SAME ROOM. First installation went so easy and quick I decided to do the first room over and add the adjoining family room. Had every problem everyone discusses here. Blooming on end joints days later. Plenty of space etc. No binding or anything. Laminate floor quality varies greatly even within a brand, maybe by manufacture run, and shipping &amp; handling. Out of register, out of square, out of level, you name it. Nightmare. Bad right out of the box. So, don&#039;t feel bad about the fact that somebody got a good lot and had no trouble but you did. Return the crap if possible. Warehousing may have caused moisture damage that you could not see or prevent until later. Companies DO NOT stand by their products anymore. This was Yorktown Collection by Palmetto Road, 7mm. 15 year manufacturer guarantee. Company sending me to the RETAILER, here is their response: 
We&#039;re sorry to here about your troubles. We&#039;ve never experienced anyone having trouble with tongue and groove engagement with our products. Please contact your retailer for further assistance in possible filing a warranty claim if your problem is due to manufacturing defect. You should also be aware that any damage done in shipping is not a manufacturing defect and if you purchased your product through an internet sales site it is not covered under terms of the Palmetto Roads Warranty which can be found here]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Carly,

I can relate to you as well. My dad has been recently diagnosed with stage Iv insulinoma, a cancer of cells in the pancreas. It is affecting his blood sugar levels and it is a constant fight to raise them with meds and dextrose. The cancer metastasized to his lymph nodes, adrenal glands, liver and spinal column. He is unable to walk because two of the tumors are wrapped around his spinal cord. They just told me that he may never be able to regain his mobility in his legs. Luckily he is not experiencing any pain - yet - and I know what the future holds. I lost my mother in 2008 to scleroderma, and then my close friend died of pancreatic cancer in August 2012. My 14.5 yr old dog died New Year&#039;s Eve of that year and my brother died the following month, January 2013 of brain cancer which was only previously diagnosed in December 2012. I was always closer to my dad, even while my brother and I were growing up. I am 41 yrs old and I lost and am losing my whole family. I will be familyless so to speak as my 90yr old maternal grandmother has early onset dementia and my maternal uncle lives in France. I have friends and neighbours that help but I wish my dad were healthy. I know I&#039;m strong enough to survive this but I get so extremely sad sometimes that I am too afraid to start crying because I might not stop. 

What I have seen with the other people in my life and what I don&#039;t want to see is my dad suffer. But I know that will be the inevitable fate.

I&#039;m meeting with the whole team (again!) as they may decide to respect part of the tumor. Surgery, not to mention the post op will be hard. My dad is still a relatively healthy 73 yr old strapping Italian man! Lol! The thing is I love to laugh and I don&#039;t really feel much like laughing these days. Every time I&#039;m at work I just want to be with my dad. I spend my nights and weekends at the hospital because I don&#039;t want to miss any moment with my dad; to do other wise for me would be unthinkable. 

Wishing you all the best.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey. My Boyfriend&#039;s birthday is in a month, and I want to make sure I have everything down before-hand. I want to throw him a nice surprise party but I&#039;m absolutely horrible at being conspicuous when I&#039;m asking him something. For instance: His favorite type of cake. I want this to be special! Another problem I&#039;ve come across is the location. I could have it at his house and tell his parents, but I don&#039;t know about that. I also could have him over at MY house but there&#039;s honestly not enough room for more than 4 guests at a time. We&#039;re not old enough for bars or restaurant reservations.

I also want his party to be decent sized, but he&#039;s not friends with a lot of people. I could invite MY friends but he doesn&#039;t hang out with them a lot and it would be awkward to be in a party with people you barely talk to.

I was thinking a surprise party that surprises him, and let&#039;s him have a good time. Maybe after recovering from shock and eating a few snacks, we could all play some videogames. Would that be ideal?

Thanks. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My biggest worry is getting our fur baby back out of Costa Rica. We do a lot of 2 week holidays and I would love to take Zoey with us as it is cheaper to have her fly Westjet with us. Do we need a vet in Costa Rica to sign off there before coming back to Toronto? We almost took her this past June but I was told by the Costa Rican embassy that I needed the CFIA vet form to be naturalized by an office on Bloor street. I am totally confused. We bought a condo in Playas del Coco and love that everyone there seems to have a dog...it&#039;s so hard to find firm straight answers. Any help would be welcomed!!!!]]></description>

Glad to know that everyone here is having problems and this seems to continue over the years.  This fucking extra page addition to my document is...oh let me say...about to make me throw this computer and the software in the pond.  Instead of that, I simply called Microsoft and gave the person on the other end a piece of my mind...although I dont know who had the heavier accent mine or his.  Let&#039;s just say I am sure it did no good but it did kinda make me feel better after fucking cussing that fucker up one side of the room and down the other!  so in closing I will just say...Hey Microsoft...fuck off!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Has anyone tried taking the south train home during rush hour (Deemed 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.)

You&#039;re lucky if you can actually get ON the train...doesn&#039;t matter which stop, you&#039;ll be hard pressed to get on. NE trains come by and just before they leave downtown they are still pretty much half full. South train, good luck. You&#039;re better off taking the train all the way to the west end of downtown, switching over to a south train and hope you can fit in. The NW and West trains are the same as the NE trains....you can at least get on the fricken train. I&#039;ve waited for almost 30 min before I could actually get into a train during winter time...not fun.

Transit says they run a ratio of 1.4 to 1 for south vs north trains (equates roughly into a 3-2 ratio) and I have yet to see this even remotely consistent. IN fact, most of the time its the other way around...I see more back to back NE trains then I do anything else....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those buses probably left really early. There have been a couple times where I&#039;ve tried catching the last bus from Crowfoot, and the driver simply took off over 10 minutes early! Thanks, your 10 minutes of gained sleep cost me nearly an hour of mine!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi All,

I am so deeply sorry for all you have and are going through, but am also comforted to know I am not alone.

My strong, wise, and fearless father has recently been diagnosed with primary kidney cancer that has metastasized in his neck, lymph nodes, and now his bones.  The doctors say it is terminal and are not providing him with treatment - alternatively, they are hoping to make him comfortable by lessening his pain.

I can relate to so many of your words, especially those about watching a  loved one deteriorate before your eyes.  I wonder each day if I will be able to converse with him the next time I see him, or if these are my last moments with Dad.  

I love him dearly - he is my best friend and I can&#039;t picture my life without him in it.

Today he told me, &quot;the only fight you lose is the one you don&#039;t show up to&quot;.  My Dad is a fighter.  And he&#039;s a winner because he refuses to give up. 

My heart goes out to all of you in these hard moments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to throw a surprise party for my husband&#039;s birthday in August.  My problem is that he really WANTS to have a party, so I&#039;m having trouble figuring out a suitable decoy.  I kind of set the groundwork by telling him I&#039;m done planning parties this year since we had a big bash for our daughter a couple months ago, and I suggested we have a big dinner at a restuarant with a bunch of friends and family for his.  He wasn&#039;t terribly thrilled about that plan, and I can&#039;t think of anything besides planning an actual decoy party (maybe &quot;scheduled&quot; for the day after) to make him happy and still be able to surprise him.  Do you have any brilliant suggestions?  If you are even still around answering questions anymore :)]]></description>
