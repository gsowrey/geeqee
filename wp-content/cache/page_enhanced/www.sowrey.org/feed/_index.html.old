				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m currently in Ontario, taking the opportunity to visit with my family. It&#8217;s always a strange feeling to come back here: it&#8217;s where I was born and grew up, but I&#8217;ve been gone for over 15 years. A lot has changed. You really can&#8217;t go home again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that I entirely like or dislike the way things currently are. I&#8217;m a bit indifferent, I guess. This is now some place for me to go to, to visit, but not where I feel particularly rooted. That&#8217;s what change does to you, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, there are some things that I do miss.&nbsp;<br />
<span id="more-3504"></span></p>
<p>One of the first things I missed was my family. A bit of a well, duuuuh! for some of you, I&#8217;m sure. These are people who know me well, who I can&#8217;t deceive in the slightest. There are no walls, no barriers. Openness and honesty is the only option, and painful it may periodically be, it&#8217;s always necessary and cathartic. There&#8217;s no blame or regret. I&#8217;m thankful for it each time, and especially this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next are my friends, whom I miss their company, and frequently miss getting to see when I&#8217;m out: too much going on, and not enough time. I worry that this visit will be no different, but with luck things will work in my favour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then comes a weird one: bugs. Specifically cicadas and crickets. Alberta has mosquitoes, about the only bug other than bees, wasps, and houseflies that make any sound. Southern Ontario gets cicadas, and this seems to be a high year of their cycle: loud buzzing everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This drives some people nuts. For me, though, it&#8217;s the sound of summer. The sound of being in my parent&#8217;s backyard, swinging on the swingset, playing in my sandpile, or swimming in the pool (yes, I had a pool growing up).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the evenings, after the sun went down, there were the crickets. I think I may miss the crickets more. Their chirps were my summertime lullaby, my reassurance that all was well with the world. I&#8217;ve never heard a single chirp in Alberta, I don&#8217;t even know if they exist out that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crickets came out on the warm nights, which were always my favourite ones to drive around at 2am from a friend&#8217;s place, taking the long way to enjoy the soft draft that came through the open windows as you cruised down some empty road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, at least when I lived here, three warm nights (coming from hot, muggy days) usually netted a whip-cracking thunderstorm that would rattle windows, and light up the darkest curtains for hours on end. I so dearly mIss watching the bolts from the kitchen window with my mom. The mornings after were always damp and crisp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had to into Toronto during the day, I took a GO Train. Thirty-five years on, you&#8217;ll still hear the conductor asking you to &#8220;stand clear of the doors, please&#8221;. There&#8217;s something wonderfully sane that it&#8217;s still done by a real person, and not a recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And since this is <i>me</i>&nbsp;that we&#8217;re discussing, let&#8217;s also mention the things I don&#8217;t miss:&nbsp;</p>
<p>First up is that hot mugginess I mentioned earlier. Being near the Great Lakes led to a lot of humidity. Combine that with 35C temperatures, and it gets pretty uncomfortable pretty quick. I&#8217;ve been damp with sweat since I stepped off the plane a few days ago. The only time I&#8217;ve been less comfortable was Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I would be remiss not to mention the traffic. Dear God, the traffic! (I took the GO Train not just because it was a train.) I genuinely do not understand people who drive when they have a choice to <i>not.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially on Hwy 400 northbound on a long weekend. Which I currently am (but I&#8217;m not actually driving).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So those of you in Calgary who complaint about the Deerfoot? Try Yonge and the 401 sometime, and then try to convince me that the Anderson road interchange is the worst thing ever.&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I&#8217;ve been wrestling with the Calgary Board of Education</strong> for a couple of years, now. And it&#8217;s not for anything complicated. To be honest, all I have is a simple hope: to have my children go to a school where they don&#8217;t have to worry about if they&#8217;re staying in the school, or if there will be a school at all. Note that this is a &#8220;hope&#8221;, not anything more concrete&#8230;</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve come to realize a few nasty things about <strong>how the public education system works in this city</strong>. The internals of the <strong>CBE are highly secretive</strong> (finding out who is actually in charge of certain things is about as easy as learning the inner workings of CSIS), and so intensely political that decisions appear to be made utterly at random, against student interests. None of this seems to go through check-and-balance because &#8230; well, <strong>there&#8217;s no accountability to anyone</strong>, nor does anyone take responsibility.</p>
<p>As a result <strong>the CBE, as a whole, is failing</strong>. And that needs to change.</p>
<p><span id="more-3432"></span>The system is split into <strong>three basic parts</strong>: <strong>the teachers</strong> (who generally do an exemplary job, given limited resources), the <strong>board administration</strong> (at this point, pretty much the polar opposite of the teachers), and the <strong>Board of Trustees</strong> (elected, but ineffectual).</p>
<p>The teachers are, at the heart of the CBE, the gears that allow the machine to move forward. (I&#8217;m sure the board administration would say it&#8217;s them. It&#8217;s not.) So <strong>we&#8217;re not going to worry too much about the teachers</strong>. Yes, we can delve into the problems of tenure and people past their prime, but those folks have a limited impact.</p>
<p>And while I would love to (figuratively and literally)<strong> throw the administration under a bus</strong>, that&#8217;s a tough challenge. While I see <strong>utterly inept planning</strong> (bordering on outright lying, which I&#8217;ve had happen to my face), <strong>impenetrable organization</strong>, <strong>unavailable communication</strong>, and <strong>top-down decision-making</strong> that gets dictated without input from the bottom, these are not things that we cannot change without pressure from someone else with authority.</p>
<p>And authority, at least with the CBE, seems to necessarily involve the one holding the purse strings.</p>
<p>Every year, the <strong><a href="http://www.cbe.ab.ca/about-us/budget-and-finance/Documents/Budget-Briefing-April-6-2015.pdf" target="_blank">CBE receives about $1.25 <em>billion</em> a year</a></strong> for operating the schools in Calgary. That translates into over $9,000 per student (CBE&#8217;s own numbers). Obviously, each student doesn&#8217;t see that funding, that&#8217;s just an average. Those dollars are broken down into how the CBE operates.</p>
<p>However, <strong>there is considerable concern</strong> (largely from parents) that the Resource Allocation Method (an algorithm that apparently is subject to privacy laws, so parents can&#8217;t actually see it) is funnelling away funds from schools back into the CBE &#8230; for <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the vagueness that&#8217;s driving a lot of concerned parents (and yes, I am one) a bit off the edge. <strong>The CBE is protecting their own information for unknown purposes.</strong> They won&#8217;t even disclose the reasons why. It&#8217;s like asking your child why they broke your favourite lamp, and with pieces of said broken lamp in their hands, they respond: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>The CBE is not transparent</strong> when it comes to funding. Not even close. They&#8217;re quick to pull the &#8220;privacy&#8221; card and not discuss the details. Details that, ultimately, concern the very they&#8217;re supposedly protecting. (I do have to ask exactly <em>how</em> my child&#8217;s name has been directly attached to operating budgets. That seems a bit <em>wrong</em> to me.)</p>
<p>This all happens for one simple reason: <strong>no-one is telling the CBE they&#8217;re doing it wrong</strong>. Or to be more specific, no-one with <em>authority</em>.</p>
<p>Supposedly, that&#8217;s what the <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/872020/what-does-a-school-board-trustee-actually-do/" target="_blank">CBE&#8217;s Board of Trustees</a> is supposed to do. That&#8217;s why we elect them. Except that over many years,<strong> it&#8217;s become exceptionally hard to actually <em>trust</em> our trustees</strong>. There&#8217;s issues of transparency, <a href="http://metronews.ca/news/calgary/963030/accusations-fly-during-impromptu-calgary-board-of-education-trustee-call-to-metro-reporter/" target="_blank">being belligerent to the media</a>, ignoring parents (this one I&#8217;ve experienced myself), and <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?q=cbe+board+trustees+%22closed+door%22+-cbe.ab.ca" target="_blank">controversial &#8220;closed door&#8221; matters</a>. It also doesn&#8217;t help that the Board of Trustees apparently voted out their own authority, putting into the hands of the CBE&#8217;s Chief Superintendent. You know, the head of the very group the Board of Trustees is supposed to monitor?</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a better approach: put the very people who have the most vested interest in the CBE&#8217;s operations as oversight. <strong>We, the parents.</strong></p>
<p>Every year, in every single CBE school across the city, we elect a Parent Council. Every Parent Council follows a set of operating rules, which includes the election of a <strong>Chair of the Parent Council</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I propose that these Chairs then form a CBE Parent Chair Council</strong>, a group that meets month (or as needed, if matters dictate) to deal with larger issues. They are the ones tasked with broadcasting information from the CBE operations down to the parents of their respective schools. They also help communicate the specific issues from their schools back to the Council.</p>
<p>The Parent Chair Council, in turn, elects from themselves a Board of Governors. The Board of Governors are the replacement for the current Board of Trustees. But this is not a one-for-one swap, as that achieves only a little. In addition to the <strong>establishment of a parent-run Board of Governors</strong>, we bestow upon them the <em>authority</em> to demand information from the CBE, to which the CBE must comply. (This is something the province needs to enact, as the CBE itself will not change without outside influence.)</p>
<p>Already I can hear the complaints: <strong>How is this any different than the mess we currently have?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parents with children <em>currently </em>in the CBE are in control.</strong> Once children have left the CBE, parents become (necessarily) disengaged.</li>
<li>The election of the Board of Governors is an extension of the election of the Chair of a given school&#8217;s Parent Council: <strong>parents putting trust in one of <em>their own</em></strong> to represent them.</li>
<li><strong>Any member of the Board of Governors can be ousted at any time</strong> by the <em>current</em> rules that elect a Chair of Parent Council: someone who loses the trust in their school&#8217;s parents would be voted out at the school level, thereby removing that Chair from both the Parent Chair Council and the Board of Governors.</li>
<li><strong>Real authority would be given</strong> (again, requiring provincial mandate) that would allow the Board of Governors to truly <em>govern</em> the CBE (see, there&#8217;s a reason for the name!). I know this is a sticky part, but I do not see it as unrealistic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, one major point I know some will raise: <strong>where would people find the time to do all of this?</strong> I mean, being on the Board of Governors is a lot of work, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it is. Two counters to that point, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Board of Trustees already invest a fair bit of time</strong> with the existing situation. So it&#8217;s not unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>There are parents in this city who are more than willing to invest that time</strong> because they <em>believe</em>. Every school has a few of these people, and interestingly, they&#8217;re often ones who put themselves up for election as the Chair of their Parent Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other obvious elephant is <strong>the teeth the province needs to bestow upon the Board of Governors</strong>. This is not a trivial aspect, but it is something that can be readily defined. It&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t see similar constructs for other &#8220;watchdog&#8221; agencies who ultimately can deliver painful judgements against governments and/or industries.</p>
<p>It is time for the <strong>parents to take back their schools</strong>, and require more of an organization that demands more and more, while delivering less and less. Parents get engaged very quickly, and can do a far better job as a collective interest than <strong>long-standing obstacles who march only to their political aspirations</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>[It should go without saying that this is an opinion piece: my opinion. It may not be yours. Politically, I&#8217;ve been centre most of my life. Today? I genuinely don&#8217;t know.]</em></p>
<p class="p1">Alberta has entered another provincial election, our fifth since the beginning of the millennium (that’s every <i>three years</i>, on average). And in <strong>Alberta, a province of wealth and entitlement</strong>, that means the old guard fending off competitors who dare lay siege to the castle, <strong>replete with feces-slinging</strong> (we’re well past mere mud), ethically-laden promises, and scare tactics, from all sides.</p>
<p class="p1">Canada is also heading down the road to a <strong>federal election</strong>, which by schedule we will see this fall. We will likely see <strong>the same slinging and fearmongering</strong>, not only because the same mentalities are at play, but because we’ve been witnessing the preamble for several months, now.</p>
<p class="p1">And all of it has shown one thing: that <strong>our politicians have forgotten about Canadians</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-3428"></span>The squabbling alone is like <strong>listening to the group of neighbourhood kids fight over a favoured toy</strong>. The younger ones are petulant, the older ones use their physical strength and bully to get their way. Some of the other kids in between ages argue logically, but receive neither support nor a sympathetic ear. All I hear, as the parent who wishes them to sort anything out, is crying, fighting, and threats of tattling to parents.</p>
<p class="p1">The same thing happens in our political landscape, just without the benefit of (somewhat) impartial parents to sort out the mess and restore order. The parents we should have — <strong>the Canadian people</strong>, acting through an election — <strong>have become disillusioned, disaffected, and apathetic</strong>. As a whole, we have stopped caring. And as much as I, and others, have tried to blame this on the Canadian people, the reality is that we cannot blame the people. Individual persons, perhaps, but as a collective, the Canadian people have lost faith in government.</p>
<p class="p1">For a person to care, they <strong>need to feel attachment</strong> to something. To get that attachment, we need three things, in order:</p>
<h2 class="p1">Vision</h2>
<p class="p1">Most important of any politician’s toolbelt should be a concept of what they want to achieve, something that they know their constituents need. Sadly, most politicians fall short into short-term or simple goals: lower taxes (which politicians never lower), more jobs (which politicians don’t control), better education (which politicians take neither accountability nor responsibility), and so forth. <strong>We’ve all heard these promises, every single election.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">These are not visions, <strong>these are <em>tactics</em></strong>. Real vision comes from things that are far more intangible, such as understanding the division between the wealthy and the poor, looking to the health and welfare not of today’s children but those who will come in two generations, looking at how we are truly perceived on a global stage and knowing we could be better, preparing for a world with an ever-expanding population with less space.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our governments do not offer vision. They offer fear.</strong> Ruling parties tell us we are in danger, so take away the freedoms of the many to benefit the extremely few; they tell us we cannot have sustainable incomes from a consistent tax base, to placate business, they tell us that the present is failing and sacrifice our future. Our opposing parties are no better, instead choosing to define themselves only by how they will reverse ruling party’s efforts, or how they will do things different.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Such actions offer no inspiration, no dreams, no hope.</strong> They serve only to oppress and defeat, leaving Canadians with nothing more than apathy. Without vision, we fall into mere name-calling, and petty arguments. We don’t have anything new to believe in, so we fall back on what we already believe, regardless of how flawed it may be. And we’ll fight to the death to protect those beliefs, because <strong>we’re human, and we loathe others telling us what to believe</strong> in the absence of new thought.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Charisma</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Part of the problem of vision, even when it is available, is an inability to connect with Canadians. While making public appearances, they certainly glad-hand everyone they can find with big, wide smiles … but this is not a connection. After such events, <strong>Canadians will no more relate to a politician as they will to the politician in a sound bite on TV</strong>. We relate better to actors in trashy B-movies than we do the people we’re supposed to trust with our future. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The leader of our nation, Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper, has the <strong>personality of a cardboard cutout</strong>. Hon. Thomas Mulcair, the leader of the official opposition, is <strong>identifiable more by his beard</strong> than anything he has said or done. And our supposed saviour, Hon. Justin Trudeau, scion of Canadian political legend, has somehow managed to turn himself into a bizarre punchline, where lately his <strong>only defining attribute is reverse-parroting</strong> nearly everything the Prime Minister says. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nevermind our provincial woes: a recently-elected Premier who, starting off with supposedly open eyes, has turned a deaf ear; the official opposition imploded; and <strong>the polls show the province tearing itself down the middle</strong>, with divisions widening daily. There is not a single person who has stepped up within the province to show a new way to think, nothing beyond promises of old that have been broken time and time again. <strong>Not a single party who defines hope</strong>, not a single hope for the change we so desperately need. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sadly, <strong>our politicians appear to have started to ignore us</strong>. They only truly care when elections are in the wind, for obvious reasons. Otherwise, they&#8217;re more preoccupied with each other, with in-fighting, name-calling, petty one-up-manship, and throwing people under busses (figuratively speaking that is; if that ever turns literal, we&#8217;ll have bigger problems to solve). The net result isn&#8217;t even entertainment, anymore. It&#8217;s irritation.</p>
<p class="p1">Worse still, we <strong>Canadians still end up dividing on ideological lines</strong>, blindly painting ourselves Blue, Red, and Orange because &#8230; well, because that party is how I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to think. But that paint is a two-way street, and <strong>the actions and words of the politicians flows down to the people</strong>, tarnishing the ideal of what that paint was supposed to be, and the Painted People argue about what&#8217;s ideal, despite the reality.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not like Canada has not seen charismatic, even idiosyncratic politicians before. I&#8217;ll sidestep an obvious one, largely because my province has a ridiculously long memory and a terribly short sight.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Instead, I&#8217;ll look to the late <strong>Hon. Jack Layton, who set a benchmark in Canada</strong> for the very things that Canadians were longing for: helping Canadians, not scaring them. He ignored personal attacks, choosing instead to inspire. He made fun of himself on <i>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</i>, engaged Quebecois in their language, and despite a strange police run-in (an unproven but suspected smear campaign), his trustworthiness amongst those polled topped out at 97%. In the following election, the NDP — the “left wing” party, formerly the butt of many political jokes — became the official opposition for the first time in federal politics. When Layton died in August 2011, the nation mourned the loss of <strong>our last great statesman</strong>.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Leadership</h2>
<p class="p1">This leads me to the last major problem with our politicians: their inability to lead. They are defined as leaders of their respective parties certainly — they are elected from within the party for that very purpose. That does not, however, necessarily define them as leaders of Canadians.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine, if you will, a crowd in a large field. A single person steps from the crowd, raises their hand, and promptly marches off in a direction. Some of the crowd will undoubtedly follow, either because they know the person or because they have a like mind. The rest may follow over time, some due to not wishing to remain in the field, some due to the pressure of others leaving. Some will remain, and possibly follow someone else who marches off in a different direction.</p>
<p class="p1">Now imagine that same crowd in a dark tunnel. There are two ways to go, and almost no-one knows the right way. One person, armed with a flashlight, walks ahead to look for dangers: open holes, tripping rocks, unstable walls, and so forth. Nearly all will follow, if just not to be left in the dark.</p>
<p class="p1">These are the <strong>two leadership patterns we see in Canada: follow by choice, or follow by fear</strong>. Both are problematic, though most people, when asked, would prefer the choice. It doesn’t matter whether or not your choice may lead you off a cliff, you just wish to know that you feel right about something. In both cases, <strong>the key missing element is education</strong>. With fear, you’re offering only the downside: follow me, or else. With choice, you’re selling only the benefits: follow me, for I have cookies!</p>
<p class="p1">So what’s best? <strong>Follow by understanding.</strong> Yes, we have cookies, and they are delicious, but some have raisins, and we know they’re not for everyone. Allow people to know what you stand for, why that matters, why you think you’ll make mistakes, where you will draw lines, and how much you’re willing to risk to bring your vision. <strong>A rare politician is one who does not worry immediately about the next election</strong>, but more about the people they represent.</p>
<h2 class="p1">But Where’s the Proof?</h2>
<p class="p1">It took me a long time to realize that we had an example of how it <i>could</i> be done. And, somewhat ironically, it exists in a place we don&#8217;t expect to see greatness: in municipal government. I can look at my own city and see the proof. Calgary is a microcosm of Canada: a right-leaning, multi-cultural, fast-growing city that has, historically, had a lacklustre governing body.</p>
<p class="p1">Until 2012, the general impression of City Council was anything but transparent, ruled largely by old guard red tape, with but a few who fought for real change. Then in 2012, the change happened: a man with a vision of what Calgary could be, that flew in the face of some of that old guard, asked <strong>people to believe not necessarily <em>in</em> him, but <em>with</em> him</strong>. And people could, because he had a personality that was infectious, one that made you <em>want</em> to believe. He followed through, showing people how things could really be done.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Mayor Naheed Nenshi proved to a right-leaning city that had stopped caring, that you <i>could</i> do different.</strong> For his first term, Calgary became a very different place. It felt more energetic, more interesting and vibrant, more passionate. He did so well, that he got reelected. He continues to express his opinions, his vision, his desire for change, and his will to put himself out for public approval.</p>
<p class="p1">Is Mayor Nenshi popular with everyone? Of course he isn’t — he rubs some people badly, and they would love to see him unseated. And, to some degree, Mayor Nenshi doesn’t seem to care. <strong>Opposition is seen as a healthy thing, to foster debate, to find middle grounds, to develop long-lasting solutions.</strong> And despite perceptions of some city councillors working more for corporate interests than their constituents, the City of Calgary functions more like the Canada I knew as a child: with mutual respect, honest debate, and a desire to do Calgarians proud.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This is what our politicians are missing: pride.</strong> They’ve forgotten how to inspire through vision, engage through charisma, and gain a following through leadership. This Alberta election is a farce, and our next federal election will be like watching poo-flinging monkeys.</p>
<p class="p1">Our only hope is that someone recognizes this, and brings change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty years ago this month &#8212; and very possibly this week, though I&#8217;m not 100% certain of that &#8212; I entered into the very nascent industry of digital marketing. At the time, the project had been little more than a simple idea, something to possibly prove my own abilities, a problem that sort of needed solving. And yet, little did I know at the time, it would send me down a long and sometimes disturbingly windy path.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a milestone where one does need to consider &#8230; well, everything. Honestly, a bit of reflection and introspection is needed from time to time, but the decade markers seem to have a certain extra amount of importance. Though to be honest, that&#8217;s just a perceived thing; there&#8217;s no legal or social reason that I&#8217;m aware of. It&#8217;s more about having a well-defined chunk of time to really take that step back and say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye gods I&#8217;m getting old&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-3426"></span></p>
<p>Twenty years seems like such a long time. Indeed, it&#8217;s just less than half of my life at this point. A lot has happened in those twenty years, not just in my own personal life (which is considerable), but also in my industry, which as I noted earlier, barely existed when I started.</p>
<p>I learned HTML in my ENGL 209 course at the University of Waterloo, taught by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/neil-randall" target="_blank">Professor Neil Randall</a>. Why an English professor was teaching markup was a bit baffling at the time. I learned later that he wrote frequently for <em>PC Magazine</em>, and was a hardened geek. (He still is.) When he gave us the option of filing &#8220;webpages&#8221; instead of papers, I leapt at the change. (Yes, <em>change</em>, not <em>chance</em>.)</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, I took at a job at a company near Don Mills and the 401 in Toronto, writing manuals for a financial software company. Nearby was a small store called &#8220;Movie Poster Warehouse&#8221;. One day, at lunch, I strolled over to peer in and see what it was all about.</p>
<p>Shelley, the owner, told me a bit of their history, most of which went clear through my head at the time: I was absolutely enthralled with the (literal) <em>warehouse</em> of movie posters. Not the junky Imaginus stuff that does the campus circuit. I mean <em>real</em> movie posters. Some of them decades old, and many in pristine original condition. As a rather hard-core movie addict (at the time, anyway), I couldn&#8217;t resist buying one before my lunchtime ran out.</p>
<p>But as I left, I asked if they had a website. &#8220;What&#8217;s a website?&#8221; she asked. And so it began&#8230;</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961222132316/http://www.movieposter.com/" target="_blank">first website went up in March 1995</a>. My friend Scott did the design, I did the build. I look back on it and cringe a bit, but it was my first professional foray, and my first real beginning to understand how marketing and commerce would work online. (They&#8217;re still online, <a href="https://ca.movieposter.com/" target="_blank">though under a different domain</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve done websites for so many companies that I&#8217;m not even sure I can remember them all. I&#8217;ve done nearly every kind of website at some point, for companies and organizations of nearly every size, in a dozen different languages, in at least a dozen different countries. I&#8217;ve lived the Agency Life™, and lived to tell about it. Well, tell about some of it. I can&#8217;t tell you all of it, either due to having forgotten, or &#8230; well, some things do need to remain a secret.</p>
<p>So, twenty years down the road, I&#8217;m still at it. I&#8217;m still a developer at heart, looking at the technology and technical needs of a solution. Not necessarily &#8220;site&#8221;, I should add &#8212; not all problems lead to a website, and the internet is so much more than HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You need to know a lot more to make a solution work: you need to know what works, how it works, and when best to use it. And all of that has changed from those first few HTML tags I learned so many years ago.</p>
<p>I look back and I can say there&#8217;s been really only one constant in all of this: change. I know that&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll hear a lot in nearly every industry, but the truth is that digital marketing changes constantly. Daily, even. There hasn&#8217;t been a single week in those twenty years when I&#8217;ve not had to look into something different or new. Because that&#8217;s the nature of the internet, which is the real basis for digital marketing: it allows that kind of change.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t keep up with that change? You die. Or worse, you become irrelevant. Not changing, not keeping up with change, is a death sentence. Others will eclipse you in short order, and no matter how loud your thunder may have been, someone else&#8217;s lightning will be crisper, brighter, and faster.</p>
<p>In a way, web developers become slaves to change: we&#8217;re always on the watch for new things, new ideas. We&#8217;re simultaneously excited by them, and terribly burdened by them. The vast majority of us are self-taught, having learned by trial and error, and often trial by fire. We&#8217;ve all been burned, overloaded, unappreciated, misunderstood, belittled, and regularly forgotten.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ugly reality, but it&#8217;s a painful truth of where web developer lie in the digital marketing world: we&#8217;re the nameless few. We don&#8217;t win awards for amazing code; we get praised for being on budget (which is difficult), and chastised when things don&#8217;t work perfectly (it&#8217;s exceptionally difficult &#8212; and expensive &#8212; to be perfect).</p>
<p>&#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,&#8221; wrote Arthur C. Clarke. I offer a corollary: &#8220;Any sufficiently skilled developer can make the impossible seem magical.&#8221; When we do our jobs well, no-one notices. How&#8217;s that for irony?</p>
<p>Actually, that&#8217;s not entirely true. When you do your job better than someone else, then you&#8217;re noticed &#8230; and not in a good way. Hence, the first rule of the internet: There will always be someone better than you. That means you need to be ready to adapt at a moment&#8217;s notice. And the day I can no longer adapt is the day I forever leave this industry, because I won&#8217;t be able to keep up.</p>
<p>Today is not that day. Tired, I may be. Exhausted even. That&#8217;s a result of age (I&#8217;m no spring chicken, anymore), home life (my kids are awesome, but they have boundless energy), and evolution (the act of changing is draining). But I&#8217;m not done.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be done until I say I&#8217;m done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m having some serious trouble, Choo Choo. You&#8217;re five. FIVE. You&#8217;ve hit that penultimate step from wee babe to being a grade-schooler (the last, obviously, is going to Kindergarten; at least we have a few months before that).</p>
<p>But still, <em>five</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-3425"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;re a funny one, Choo Choo. You may be the oldest in your preschool class, but you sure don&#8217;t act your age. And I&#8217;ll be honest, that is what I love about you. You&#8217;re playful, loving, accepting, and stupidly adorable (something you seem to instinctively know, and use to your advantage, I might add). You skip more than you walk or run (I call you &#8220;Skippy&#8221; for a reason). You love doing flips by holding my hands, walking up my legs and flipping over backwards. You&#8217;ll curl up on Mommy&#8217;s or my lap as readily as Asia. You&#8217;re trying to not grow up.</p>
<p>And yet, you are. You&#8217;re taller than your sister was when she turned five. You&#8217;ve outgrown and/or destroyed several pairs of pants. You&#8217;re bigger than the bike you learned to ride last summer. You don&#8217;t fit in pretty much anything meant for a pre-schooler. Your car seat no longer uses its five-point harness. You can power back a pretty big chicken dinner.</p>
<p>But my <em>lord</em> do you have the sweetest face, the most wonderful (and ear-piercing) shriek when you&#8217;re having fun, you tell the greatest stories, and your imagination runs rampant in ways I can&#8217;t even begin to describe. I know that the day you actually decide to let us teach you how to read, you&#8217;ll discover great new things.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. You&#8217;re not there just yet.</p>
<p>For now, you&#8217;re still my wee one. Even if you&#8217;re not so wee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Monkey, you&#8217;re seven.</p>
<p>Like, <em>seven.</em> I&#8217;m having trouble really saying that. It&#8217;s just weird that you&#8217;re so much older than I always feel like you should be. You&#8217;re growing up a little more every day, and flit between my little girl and &#8230; well, kind of an evil genius, really.</p>
<p>And truly, both are awesome.</p>
<p><span id="more-3424"></span></p>
<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s start with the obvious: Your birthday was two days ago, not today. We were all in Banff, enjoying ourselves. And by &#8220;we&#8221;, I am, of course, referring to the entire troupe: Mommy, you, Choo Choo, and myself, plus Auntie Cathy and Uncle Craig and your cousins, plus Nana and Auntie B. That was Auntie Cathy&#8217;s idea. Going up a mountain? That was Uncle Craig&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>So let me throw you my little perspective on this one.</p>
<p>First off, neither you nor Choo Choo nor your cousins objected. Only Mommy did, and that was largely because Mommy wasn&#8217;t feeling terribly well. That left the rest of us (save for Nana and Auntie B, of course) to tackle the mountain. Sulphur Mountain, to be exact.</p>
<p>That hike, by the way, is 5.5 km straight-line distance, running about 700 m straight-up. It&#8217;s not a tough climb, per se, but let&#8217;s remember that you young&#8217;uns are topping out at eight years old, and Choo Choo&#8217;s barely four and a half. (Never mind Uncle Craig, Auntie Cathy, and I, who are far from being spring chickens, with the latter two of us having office jobs and not being in very good shape.)</p>
<p>Following a hearty (and filling) breakfast at Melissa&#8217;s across from our hotel, we drove up to the main parking lot, unloaded, and proceeded to start our climb. (Well, after Choo Choo <em>had </em>to stop to pick up a rock. She loves rocks. I don&#8217;t know why. But she wanted to carry a rock.)</p>
<p>I will give you all massive amounts of credit for the fact that none of you said a thing for the first few switchbacks. (If anything, it was the grown-ups telling you to slow down and pace yourselves.) You were having fun, even enjoying it. I was worried we&#8217;d hear &#8220;can we go back now?&#8221; after only a few bends.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t recall any of you suggesting we head back. Of course, it could be that you were all pre-empted by us saying where we were on the trail, looking at how far you&#8217;ve come, keeping you moving, and so forth. But you did have your moments &#8212; you especially, Monkey &#8212; where you were pretty much done, and didn&#8217;t want to go another step. But, of course, we gave you no real option, either: you were almost at the top, and going back down was rather pointless.</p>
<p>Still, at just over 90 minutes from starting, we all arrived at the top of a mountain. Which hugely impresses me. That&#8217;s not a quick hike for adults, let alone kids, and yet you did it pretty darned fast! And on your birthday!</p>
<p>So, no, I&#8217;m not going to make you climb a mountain on your birthdays, though cool this was. With luck, however, this will end up being the start of a better trail habit for all of us. And maybe &#8212; just <em>maybe</em> &#8212; you&#8217;ll like hiking a bit better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time &#8212; how could I, I was but a lad of 16 &#8212; my blogging alter ego, <a title="Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Leaving Canada" href="http://www.sowrey.org/1989/06/behind-iron-curtain-leaving-canada/">The Observer, was born 25 years ago today</a>.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, my family took me to the airport, dropped me into the hands of chaperones who would keep me out of the gulag (or at least out of serious trouble), and I set off on my first <em>real</em> adventure.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s actually kind of unfair. The problem with &#8220;adventure&#8221; is trying to understand it through perspective.</p>
<p><span id="more-3417"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, shall we? It is very difficult to recognize the importance of an event at the time of the event. Did anyone really know that Woodstock would become <em>the</em> event of the 60s? Did anyone truly recognize that the Battle of [Insert Location Here] would be a marker of change in [Insert War Here]? Or how the discovery of something as innocuous as &#8220;spoiled&#8221; fruit juice would bring us wine? (Okay a bit of a stretch on that last one, but you get my point&#8230;)</p>
<p>Time gives us perspective, and through perspective, we see importance. And for me, time has shown me many of the things I&#8217;ve done were adventures, even in my disturbingly-distant youth. Such as my first flight without my parents (which I recently related to Monkey), going to Disney World when I was 7 (and chickening out of <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>&#8230;), even those first few road trips (however numbingly dull they were).</p>
<p>But there was something about going to the soon-to-not-be Soviet Union, into forbidden territory that really stood out to me, and still does 25 years ago.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century. One of the (many) weird things I&#8217;ve noticed as I get older is the recognition of passed time. When I was 16, the previous quarter of my life seemed infinite in length &#8212; all four years of it &#8212; and the life ahead of me was impossible to consider. Skip ahead all those years, and <em>my god how could I have been so naive??</em> Well, there&#8217;s age for you, right?</p>
<p>I will be happy to say that the adventure is not over. I&#8217;ve had many adventures since that &#8220;first&#8221; great one, and there are many things yet to be done and seen.</p>
<p>And most importantly, I&#8217;ve now got offspring upon whom I can gift adventure, just as my grandmother gifted to me so many years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like writing. [Insert world&#8217;s largest &#8216;Well, DUH!&#8217; here.] And while I&#8217;ve been content to write a blog &#8212; great practice for any writer, if you ask me &#8212; it&#8217;s just not the same as when you write for someone else.</p>
<p>Which I have. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to write a few things (articles, not long ones) for which I&#8217;ve been paid, and presumably read. That&#8217;s a bit more rewarding than merely standing on a soapbox and yelling into The Void. But even that isn&#8217;t quite enough.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what I wanted to write a book. But not the one I just published.</p>
<p><span id="more-3415"></span>Yes, published. We&#8217;ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>First, writing a book. A book is more than just a story. The vast majority of my blog entries are in the vicinity of 1,000 words &#8212; roughly the length of an article. That&#8217;s not by design, or by requirement, it&#8217;s just how I ended up writing things out. It&#8217;s long enough for me to write something interesting, but not so long that it&#8217;s a royal pain in the keister to write and edit.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a downside to that length: it&#8217;s also not long enough to get out a really detailed story. A story with deep plot lines and interesting characters and different scenes and places. A real writer&#8217;s challenge: can I write over 200 pages (the bare minimum, I think, for a good novel) and do it (reasonably) well?</p>
<p>I asked myself this question back in 2008. I jotted some notes, and started the first basic plot line. Then I got myself involved with an idea to write a different story, which distracted me. Then I thought of more stories that kind of tied in with the first story, but then I made those more complicated, which required more stories to flesh out the entire arc.</p>
<p>And then, one day, as I was tucking Monkey into bed, she asked me: &#8220;Can you tell me a story?&#8221;</p>
<p>Monkey loves stories. I mean <em>loves</em> stories. She&#8217;s been reading (sorta) since she was only a couple of months old. No lie! I have a video of her reading Sandra Boynton, and listening intently. (Okay, <em>I&#8217;m </em>doing the reading, but trust me on this, she was paying attention!) She loved stories so much that we&#8217;ve amassed quite a collection of books. That first story I mentioned above? Inspired by having to read the same story to her over and over and over and over.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s six and a half now, and reads all on her own. She reads like a vacuum cleaner. And she has a good memory for stories and characters. She always wants another one. Which is what brought her to asking me to tell her a story. And not one I&#8217;d read to her before, she wanted something new, something I could make up.</p>
<p>Making up a story on the spot is hard. Yeah, sure, I could easily rhyme off the plots to any number of movies I&#8217;ve seen or books I&#8217;ve read, but where&#8217;s the fun in that? Where&#8217;s the challenge of conveying something through words that doesn&#8217;t already exist? Is that not the real core of any storyteller, to create a new story?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I did. As requested, I told her a story. Well, first I had to come up with the idea. And it was a simple one, to be totally honest: how to do something difficult.</p>
<p>Kids don&#8217;t like difficult. They like easy. Yes, we adults like easy as well, but we deal with difficult much better than kids, who get frustrated when they can&#8217;t do something off-the-cuff. Monkey is no different, and gets frustrated easily when she can&#8217;t quite tie her shoelaces, or falls behind because she doesn&#8217;t run as fast as the other kids.</p>
<p>For my story, I spun it as how a girl climbed a mountain. And to be totally honest, I rather impressed myself with the story, having had only fifteen seconds or so to spin the plot in my head. When I finished telling her the story, she gave me the biggest hug she&#8217;d given me in ages (and I get lots, so it was pretty huge), and told me that it was &#8220;the best story&#8221; she&#8217;d ever heard.</p>
<p>Well, ego thoroughly inflated, I raced over to my trusty laptop, and put the proverbial pen to paper, making some adjustments to the story to make it a wee bit more involved. And thus was born &#8220;The Girl Who Went Up A Mountain&#8221;. (It was originally &#8220;Climbed&#8221;, but I changed it to &#8220;Went&#8221; because the act was more about the &#8220;why&#8221; than the &#8220;how&#8221;. But I digress&#8230;)</p>
<p>And I honestly went through all the motions to publish that story, all 2,746 words of it. I was going to publish it on Kobo and Amazon, almost entirely as an experiment: how much trouble would it be? I was going to publish it for free, too, just because. Except that Amazon wouldn&#8217;t let me do it for free, I had to charge <em>something</em>, apparently.</p>
<p>That sent me back to the drawing board, where I added four more stories &#8212; all about the same length &#8212; and came up with my first book: <em>Monkeystories</em>. Why the name? Well, obvious first part: it&#8217;s named for Monkey, who inspired me to tell them. But they&#8217;re also about being a kid, and imagining, and dreaming, and being a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>Today, finally, it went out on the wire, and <em>Monkeystories</em> is now available on <a href="http://store.kobobooks.com/en-CA/ebook/monkeystories" target="_blank">Kobo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Monkeystories-Geoff-Sowrey-ebook/dp/B00JTP035Y/ref=sr_1_3" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. I have no aspirations that it&#8217;ll sell well, if at all. For me, it&#8217;s about the experiment, and writing some stories that I think Monkey would like. And it was fun.</p>
<p>(And before you all start going on how ebooks aren&#8217;t really publishing, and that unless I sign on with a &#8220;real&#8221; dead tree publisher, I&#8217;m not really published, I&#8217;ve already considered all of that. And you should know better than to not think I haven&#8217;t considered that, or believe for a moment that I was willing to put out work that wasn&#8217;t ready for consumption. Just to get that out there.)</p>
<p>I may yet write another volume, as she&#8217;s already given me the basic idea of another story that involves one of her first stuffies, a pink monkey named, somewhat oddly, &#8220;Monkey Moo&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for now, I&#8217;m returning to the book I&#8217;ve been writing for the last few months. I&#8217;m over 116,000 words on that, with at least another 20,000 to go, I think. And that&#8217;s just for the first draft. Let alone all the other stories I want to write.</p>
<p>&#8216;Cuz I&#8217;ve got lots&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Choo Choo, today I&#8217;m having a &#8220;last&#8221; moment. Today was your last full day as a three year-old. Tomorrow is your birthday. Tomorrow, you turn four. </p>
<p>And I will miss you being three immensely. You are my last three year-old.<br />
<span id="more-3413"></span></p>
<p>A long time ago, when Mommy was first pregnant with Monkey, she asked me what year I was looking most forward to. I said &#8220;three&#8221;, though I wasn&#8217;t really sure why. I think I was mildly convinced, having absolutely no data to support my claim, that three was the perfect balance of wisdom (notably the ability to hold a conversation), and cuteness (still being a little kid without the burden of having to act like an older kid). </p>
<p>It turns out I was right. Three really is the perfect age. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been dreading this day for a long time. I&#8217;m losing the last real &#8220;child&#8221; in my life &#8212; you&#8217;re growing older, and getting bigger, and acting different with each day. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to appreciate, losing one&#8217;s innocence, and even less so when it&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I probably remember your birth day more clearly than Monkey&#8217;s. That&#8217;s mostly likely because it was highly scheduled, anticipated, and planned. Which, of course, meant that it was completely opposite of all that. And yet, despite the adversity, you turned out as beautiful as I could ever hope or imagine. </p>
<p>Only last summer did I realize that you were no longer a baby, or even a toddler. I made the mistake of noticing that your legs extended some distance from your torso. It sounds like a strange thing to say, I know, but wee babes don&#8217;t have long legs; yours were longer than I&#8217;d remembered. And suddenly, you were no longer a wee babe. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, you cease being three. And I&#8217;m having trouble with that. I&#8217;d keep you at three, if I could. I&#8217;d keep you as young, innocent, and wonderful as you are today. But I can&#8217;t. I can only pray that I can remember you as you are today, with your wonder and amusement at everything you see. </p>
<p>I will miss you, Choo Choo at three years old. My wonderful little girl, who has given me so much joy. </p>
<p>I hope that there are many years of joy yet to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday evening, my family trucked down to 96th Ave SW, invited by the Calgary Board of Education (along with the other families in the Westgate School Bilingual Spanish program) to view the &#8220;new&#8221; school, Eugene Coste Elementary. It was supposed to be a chance to see the new location, and ask questions of the CBE Area IV director, as well as the Planning &amp; Transportation folks.</p>
<p>I emphasize the word &#8220;supposed&#8221; &#8212; that was the CBE&#8217;s perspective. They thought they would get a lot of interest, and a lot of people who were genuinely happy that a solution had been found for the accommodation woes at Westgate School, which is at over 90% of its rated capacity.</p>
<p>But, funny thing, there weren&#8217;t many happy people.</p>
<p><span id="more-3405"></span></p>
<p>When we received the official notice that Eugene Coste was the &#8220;solution&#8221; to the problem, there&#8217;s been almost the equivalent of an angry mob. (I know &#8212; I&#8217;m one of them.) And that angry mob has been inundating the CBE with emails, phone calls, petitions, and even an appeal rally in the lobby of their headquarters last Friday. It would be awfully hard for anyone at the CBE to be able to not notice that there are a lot of unhappy people.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all the warning, the CBE continued with its open house at Eugene Coste. I would like to refer to it as &#8220;Eugene Coste School&#8221; at this point, but in truth, it&#8217;s only a building with some rooms &#8212; everything that could make it a school, like desks, chairs, art on the walls, books in the library, and so forth, are utterly <em>absent</em>. The building was little more than a shell.</p>
<p>When we entered the building, we were effectively directed to what I think was previously the library, to see some information, and talk to the directors. Except there wasn&#8217;t much talking &#8212; it was largely listening to the angry parents question the directors, and listen to the directors attempt to explain their position. Amongst all of this were kids running about, having to be corralled by parents who were trying to speak their minds. There were a lot of angry parents. Amazingly, so I heard later, the CBE was surprised that so many people were unhappy about the affair.</p>
<p>Now this, dear reader, is where I give myself the facepalm. You know this expression, yes?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://forums.riftgame.com/attachments/general-discussion/9358-open-challenge-daglar-picard-facepalm.jpg" width="750" height="600" /></p>
<p>I say this because I&#8217;m utterly unable to see how the CBE thought that asking a large number of unhappy parents to drive through rush hour traffic to a school to which they&#8217;re largely opposed with their tired and hungry kids in tow (without a single distraction available to occupy them), not run a single tour of the facility to sell its virtues, and corral everyone in one room to &#8220;talk&#8221; with the people most of the angry parents are blaming in the first place, was <em>ever</em> a good idea.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>how</em> was this supposed to be successful?</p>
<p>I work in marketing. You know, the industry that exists to sell you the things you don&#8217;t really want to buy? (Okay, slightly cynical. I admit that perhaps I&#8217;ve been doing this job too long&#8230;) You can look at <em>Mad Men</em> and snicker, but the basis of the show isn&#8217;t far from reality: we make you want something.</p>
<p>The CBE didn&#8217;t even <em>try</em> to make us want to send our kids to Eugene Coste. Let&#8217;s ignore the hour-long bus rides and massive disruption to families&#8217; lives &#8212; the school building was devoid of any life whatsoever, and we didn&#8217;t even really get a chance to see much of it. And having our fears glossed over by &#8220;best case&#8221; scenarios of bus routes and timing? A little more than moderately insulting. Basically, they failed at selling the idea.</p>
<p>This is the point at which an agency is asked to leave the pitch process and not return. Or, worse, the agency&#8217;s account is brought up for review and they have to validate their existence against dozens of competitors who want the account.</p>
<p>This is something the CBE needs to figure out: how to sell awful situations to angry people. The entire city is under school space crunches, and there aren&#8217;t a lot of options for anyone. The releases we receive are emotionless, lacking sufficient information, and unable to address the fears that arise &#8212; the very things that any good marketing job should address.</p>
<p>No competition for the CBE, you say? You&#8217;d be surprised how many people are readily willing to consider the separate school system, or even the extra cost of charter schools. And we&#8217;ve got a lot of charter schools in Calgary, so this is definitely not a hypothetical scenario. The CBE just ends up with more angry customers, who won&#8217;t be willing to put up with the problem much longer.</p>
<p>So a suggestion to the CBE: you want people to like you? Get someone else to tell your story, &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re doing a lousy job of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in 2012, the Calgary Board of Education asked the parents of Westgate School what they thought of the CBE&#8217;s plan to try and alleviate the overpopulation problem. We were engaged, we went to many meetings, and then we waited. A lot. And, heaven help us, we told them to make up their minds.</p>
<p>A week ago today, they told us. And we didn&#8217;t like the answer. Not remotely. It wasn&#8217;t worst-case &#8212; it was worse than that: it was an option never previously hinted at, and while it did address some of the things that the parents had been asked for, it was wrapped up in a big ribbon of stink. In short, the <a href="http://www.westgatespanish.ca/">Westgate Spanish</a> program was going to be taken away.</p>
<p>I suppose this is a lesson in &#8220;be careful what you wish for&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-3402"></span></p>
<p>Short version: The CBE decided that all four (remaining) Spanish grades would be pulled from the school and bussed 14 kilometres away to another, currently empty, school. Across the Glenmore Trail causeway. During rush hour(s).</p>
<p>Once the &#8220;WTF&#8221; moment had passed, anger started to set in. Not so much because of the distance, but because of the betrayal. Never had the CBE even mentioned the existence of the new school (Eugene Coste Elementary), or hinting that students could be bussed such a distance away from where most students lived.</p>
<p>Right now, most students at Westgate School are bussed in, from west of the school. &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the problem, if they&#8217;re already being bussed?&#8221; you ask. And it&#8217;s a good question. The point isn&#8217;t so much that they&#8217;re being bussed, it&#8217;s the <em>distance</em>. Some kids would be spending over two hours on the bus every day, the equivalent of over 60 instructional days. There&#8217;s no world where that makes sense, in an <em>urban centre</em>, where there are other schools that should be available.</p>
<p>Oh, and then there&#8217;s the other question that I&#8217;ve heard some of you say: &#8220;Why Spanish? They should take French, which is our other official language!&#8221; Sure, it&#8217;s an optional program, no-one&#8217;s making them take it. The same goes with the French program. Oh, and that French program? That&#8217;s <em>Parisian</em> French. You just try using that in Quebec and see how far you get. In Canada, we do not teach <em>Quebecois</em> as a language outside of Quebec.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m spending far too much time trying to help a group get the CBE back into a conversation. Short version: we don&#8217;t like the presented &#8220;solution&#8221;, because it affects the students and their families far too much. It violates several of the CBE policies and principles, and even from a <em>moral</em> standpoint: who thought with honest truth that putting a kid on a bus that long <i>inside city limits</i> was the right solution?</p>
<p>I have no idea where this is going to end, yet. Right now, we&#8217;re amassing parents into a group. We&#8217;re hearing rumours from many angles, and all of them have grains of truth, and equally need grains of salt. It&#8217;s hard to tell who&#8217;s friend, and who&#8217;s just a &#8220;silent observer&#8221; (dear elected school trustees, we&#8217;re looking in your direction). The only ones truly helping us are those with the passion to not take this lying down.</p>
<p>So, yeah, loss of sleep, more stress (nosebleeds, to boot!), and I&#8217;ve had to apologise to my boss for not doing enough work, lately.</p>
<p>What do we want? A reasonable option that doesn&#8217;t involve long-distance bussing. I think it&#8217;s possible. The question is if everyone else does, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I blinked, and 2013 kind of vanished on me. It&#8217;s a blur, a seemingly endless stream of activity that rarely relented long enough for me to appreciate any of it. I have pictures to prove it, sure, but I have to struggle sometimes to remember the date, or what else might have happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly certain this isn&#8217;t (solely) a result of age. It&#8217;s parenthood. It&#8217;s a rigorous schedule that keeps the family machine moving at quite a pace. Between work schedules (which alternate such that Alex and I resemble &#8220;ships passing in the night&#8221;), school schedules, various after school activities, and the family activities, there&#8217;s very little time for much else.</p>
<p>Like, say, writing a blog.</p>
<p><span id="more-3399"></span></p>
<p>This brings me to a few revelations of the last year. The first one, which is more of an evolution than a revelation, is that I miss my kids terribly every day. I&#8217;ve always missed them, but they&#8217;re no longer babies &#8212; they&#8217;re little people with clear thoughts, (mostly) clear emotions, and they&#8217;re capable of expressing themselves. They no longer say &#8220;don&#8217;t go&#8221; when I head off to work because they want me around &#8212; they <em>sound</em> sad, they hold me longer, and it sounds more like begging than just mere missive.</p>
<p>And especially, Choo Choo. She&#8217;s still three. It seems like she&#8217;s been three for years, now, which I absolutely adore. Back before Monkey was even born, I&#8217;d told Alex that I was mostly looking forwards to the age of three, because it&#8217;s enough that a kid can talk clearly, but they&#8217;re just constantly happy, and silly, and fun, and dancing, and making up stories, and everything I thought parenthood would be. (Yes, I&#8217;ve since had the rude awakening.) My last child is growing up, and she&#8217;s no longer the wee babe I held in my arms. She&#8217;s still small, yes, but if she&#8217;s like Monkey, she&#8217;ll be growing quickly. Too quickly.</p>
<p>The next one, and likely the most painful one to realize, is that I&#8217;m not particularly happy. I love my wife, I love my kids, and that&#8217;s a lot, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But I feel like I never see my friends (especially my far-flung ones; the internet is therein a live-saver), and it&#8217;s hard to make new friends, given the aforementioned schedule. There&#8217;s also little down time from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep. Every day I see notes from people I know on Twitter or Facebook &#8212; people I know with families &#8212; who talk about the hobbies they have or the games they play, and I think: How the hell do they do it? I look at my house, it&#8217;s frequently a mess, and I feel like I&#8217;m barely above water. I don&#8217;t travel, which I used to love and miss dearly, which makes me feel confined to Calgary. And then I look at my lowly little blog, which used to get so much attention, and I&#8217;ve barely made a post a month over the last year. Maybe I need to find new happiness? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>My health ain&#8217;t what it used to be. As little as a few years ago, I was still largely invulnerable, or so it seemed. Then I got a hernia. Then appendicitis. Illnesses seem to be getting worse. And then this year, my heart palpitations sent me to a cardiologist. I&#8217;m fine, for the record &#8212; I&#8217;m actually <em>normal</em> in that sense &#8212; but the doctor did say I was exhausted, been drinking too much caffeine, and not getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>The last one was a recognition that I can no longer do any kind of freelance work. I&#8217;ve tried, repeatedly, over the years to make it work. The realities of my &#8220;day job&#8221; almost always interfere, and I usually end up disappointing others. But now, with my home life weighing in more than my job, taking on any kind of work &#8212; even pro bono &#8212; is stressful beyond comprehension. I don&#8217;t like to disappoint, especially with a friend, and the only way is to formally and completely renounce freelancing. Regardless of how much my family could use the extra income, it&#8217;s just not tenable, especially when related to my happiness problem.</p>
<p>So this will be a year of some change in that regard. I need to change <em>something</em>. &#8216;Cuz going on as it&#8217;s currently going isn&#8217;t good for my happiness, my health, or my family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By tradition, our family does afternoon (or high) tea on 1 January, and thus far it has always been at a Fairmont hotel (which, frankly, does excellent afternoon tea). This year, almost exactly one year ago today, we had our tea as planned. But last week, we came to the realization that we could not effectively hold to our traditional date, as Alex has an evening shift, and getting back from Banff in time was nigh-impossible without rushing.</p>
<p>Local? The Palliser doesn&#8217;t start until 2pm, which makes rushing just as much a problem. And no-one else in Calgary seems to be open on New Years Day. For afternoon tea, that is.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t for a lack of looking. I even went to my internet compatriots for suggestions. I got the name of nearly every tea house in Calgary, but no others that served <em>afternoon tea</em>. It seems harder than it should be&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3400"></span></p>
<p>Eventually, I came to terms with the fact that we wouldn&#8217;t be starting the new year with tea, so much as celebrating the new year with tea &#8230; just a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>Early also meant leaving Calgary at 9am for our day&#8217;s trip into the mountains. It was cold &#8212; 17 degrees below zero &#8212; and snow and hoar frost covered everything between our home and the mountains. It was wonderfully dream-like, in every way a &#8220;magical&#8221; winter should be.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived in Banff, the temperature had risen to a mere half a degree below zero (not an uncommon thing). Traffic was light, bordering on non-existent, and it was an easy trip up to the Upper Hot Springs. For the first time in probably over a decade, the spring was gushing hot water, rather than the usual trickle we&#8217;ve normally seen. Likely a result of the torrential rains we experienced last June, and a heavier snowpack, the springs are once again dependent on natural sources.</p>
<p>We arrived in the pool barely 30 minutes after the pool opened for the day, which meant it was much emptier than I&#8217;ve experienced in more recent visits. It also meant the girls needed only admonishing for splashing, rather than having to pull them out of the pool entirely for annoying everyone.</p>
<p>Bathed and dressed, we headed to the Banff Springs, where Alex and Choo Choo went to get our noon table, while Monkey and I parked the car. Our table was window-side, which I&#8217;d hoped for, allowing us a wonderful view down the Bow River valley.</p>
<p>Now, the hard part with doing afternoon tea, or any relatively nice outing that involves manners, with young children is allowing them to act their age, with restraint. Monkey has some difficulty, but generally understands; Choo Choo, on the other hand, is a bit of a handful. Alex and I have to sit opposite each other so we can properly tag-team.</p>
<p>That said, the girls did surprisingly well. They didn&#8217;t go so much for some of the fancier desserts (Monkey, inexplicably, refused to eat the multilayer chocolate cake slice on her plate), they ate without disaster, and drank almost with their pinkies out. But as one might expect, patience has its limits, and they couldn&#8217;t sit still forever.</p>
<p>We zipped down to Bow Falls, which was frozen save for a two metre-wide gush of whitewater. The rest of the river was partially open, though heavily ensconced in thick ice, a point that was made to us while watching five people rather lacking on common sense, who got very close to the river&#8217;s edge without the ice breaking. We had our phones prepped for 911, just in case. The girls made &#8220;ice cream&#8221; from rocks, sand, and pine cones on a low rock wall.</p>
<p>We tried to walk about town. We honestly thought we could spend a couple of leisurely hours wandering about, window shopping and otherwise sight-seeing. The girls, however, were done. Beyond done. That was clear after the first shop (a toy store, which may have aggravated the issue), and the parental patience ran thin, quickly. We were on the road by 4pm, the girls sound asleep before we were out of the Banff townsite limits.</p>
<p>Next year &#8212; which is tomorrow, lest we forget &#8212; we have the same issue with Alex&#8217;s work schedule. We&#8217;ll likely do the same trip. And hopefully next year, we won&#8217;t wear ourselves out so quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So some time ago, my neighbour told me about a mead-making course being offered by the <a href="http://squareknotcoop.com/">Squareknot Cooperative</a>. While he ended up not able to go (his mead is now approaching epic levels, I should add), I went, learned a few things, and started making my own.</p>
<p>At the course, I sampled a hibiscus mead with rosehips. It was one that convinced me that I should make my own mead. It was deliciously red, sweet without being coying, and exactly the thing I&#8217;d expected from a mead.</p>
<p>I finally got around to making it. And boy, did it ever turn out. I can&#8217;t help but share this so others can try, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-3394"></span></p>
<p>Mead, in case you&#8217;re not aware, is effectively honey wine. And it&#8217;s, by far, the easiest alcoholic drink you can make at home, with very little equipment, and about two months of time. Or rather, two months of <em>waiting</em> &#8212; you have to do very, very little.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll need for a <em>basic</em> mead:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 1 gallon (3.75 litre) glass jug. (I&#8217;ve started using ones that come with the Santa Cruz organic apple juice that we get from our local Sunterra. The juice is great, and the jug is perfect for the job. If you Google it, you&#8217;ll see &#8212; to no coincidence &#8212; it being used for a lot of home-brewing.)</li>
<li>1 pint (0.5 litres) of organic, non-pasteurized honey. Most grocery store-bought honey is processed, and has additives. Get the pure stuff, preferably still liquid.</li>
<li>1 packet of yeast. You can get this from a home-brewing supply shop. This should cost about $1.</li>
<li>1 rubber bung (that will fit the jug&#8217;s mouth). Conveniently, also at the wine shop. This should cost about $2.</li>
<li>An airlock that goes into the bung. This is about $5. You&#8217;ll need this to keep air from getting into the mead while it ferments.</li>
<li>Water. In principle, get spring water (also, conveniently, at the home-brewing shop), but if your local tap water is good (ie. good-tasting, low-chlorination), it&#8217;ll work.</li>
<li>Some bottles to put the mead in, once it&#8217;s ready. (You&#8217;ll need enough to &#8212; duh &#8212; equal the volume of the jug.)</li>
<li>A length of food-safe plastic hose for filling the bottles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best part of this? Once you&#8217;ve acquired these things, future meads need only the honey, yeast, and water (if you&#8217;re not using tap).</p>
<p>For the hibiscus mead, you&#8217;ll also need (duh) hibiscus. For that, get <em>real</em> hibiscus flower tea from a tea shop. Don&#8217;t buy hibiscus tea from the grocery store, as it&#8217;s usually mixed with black teas and other things; it&#8217;s also never going to deliver the right potency you&#8217;ll need. You&#8217;ll need a 300 gram (ish) packet of hibiscus &#8212; you&#8217;ll use this to make tea.</p>
<ol>
<li>In a medium-sized pot, add 1 litre of your water, the <em>entire</em> packet of hibiscus, and bring to a strong simmer (try not to boil). Note that you&#8217;ll want to let this sit at least an hour to get a strong tea (which you&#8217;ll need). Also, you&#8217;ll need it to cool to roughly room temperature before adding.</li>
<li>While the tea is brewing, make sure your jug, bung, and airlock are clean. I&#8217;m going to catch hell for this, I&#8217;m sure, but hot, soapy water has always done the trick for me, and doesn&#8217;t require the powerful cleaners wine and beer makers use. (Mead is exceptionally forgiving.)</li>
<li>Boil a small amount (1-2 cups) of your water. In a bowl, add some of the honey, and then some of the hot water, and stir until the honey is dissolved.</li>
<li>Pour the honey water into the jug, using a funnel (or by hand, if it&#8217;s steady enough). Repeat until all of the honey is in the jug.</li>
<li>Make sure the tea is room temperature (or cooler) &#8212; if it&#8217;s too hot, you&#8217;ll kill the yeast. Add it to the jug using the funnel, straining out the hibiscus petals with a sieve.</li>
<li>Top up the jug with your water. Fill only until about the base of the neck &#8212; you do not want to fill the jug completely, you need space for the yeast to bubble.</li>
<li>Add the yeast. Again, make sure the jug&#8217;s not too hot. (If the yeast doesn&#8217;t kick in within 24 hours, just add more yeast.)</li>
<li>Put the bung in, and add the airlock (you&#8217;ll need to fill the airlock with a bit of water; that&#8217;s how the air stays out).</li>
<li>Give the jug a good shake to mix the yeast with the liquid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Place your jug in a cool corner in a large tub (or alternatively, a downstairs bathtub or shower) for a couple of days. During this time, the yeast may create a lot of bubbles, and it&#8217;s possible it might &#8220;blow out&#8221; from the initial start. This is perfect fine, but it may make a bit of a mess. Once you&#8217;re past this initial stage, you get to the best part.</p>
<p>Leave the jug alone for about six weeks, depending on the yeast and honey. Seriously, don&#8217;t watch it, you don&#8217;t even really need to touch it. If you do need to look, you&#8217;ll see the airlock bubble about once every 5-10 seconds, which is normal. If you look closely, you&#8217;ll see tiny bubbles floating to the top.</p>
<p>After about six weeks, the bubbling should have subsided, if not stopped completely. If you (carefully!) pick up the jug, it should be translucent, but dark. If it&#8217;s still cloudy (which means things are still suspended in the water), put the jug back down and check again in another few days. (Don&#8217;t worry, it won&#8217;t go bad.)</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s clear, it&#8217;s bottling time. For bottles, I recommend glass ones with the flip-top ceramic-and-rubber stoppers that come on fancy lemonade bottles, but known most for Grolsch beer bottles (but, for the love all things holy, get the bottles used, don&#8217;t subject yourself to the beer). Make sure they&#8217;re clean (hot water and soap; I wash mine in an otherwise empty dishwasher).</p>
<p>Put the jug above the bottles (you need this for gravity siphoning), and start filling the bottles. You can fill them to the top if you wish &#8212; there&#8217;s no more fermentation, so there should be no additional pressure building up.</p>
<p>Then put the bottles, filled, in the same cool, dark corner for at least two weeks, and preferably four. If you sample the mead right away, you may notice that it seems kind of like a red wine. But during those 2-4 weeks, you&#8217;ll notice a transformation in the mead that turns it into red gold.</p>
<p>Now for the warning: depending your yeast, it&#8217;ll clock out at about 15% ABV (or higher), just like a regular wine. But it&#8217;ll have wonderful sweetness to it, and <em>not taste</em> like it&#8217;s that strong. Just so you know.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, CBE? I&#8217;m a concerned parent. Yeah, I know you&#8217;ve heard from a lot of us in the last year regarding what you want to do with Westgate Elementary.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, CBE? I&#8217;m a concerned parent. Yeah, I know you&#8217;ve heard from a lot of us in the last year regarding what you want to do with <a href="http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b140/">Westgate Elementary</a>. You&#8217;ve heard so much, you&#8217;re not listening to us anymore, which I can understand &#8212; there&#8217;s only so much you can hear before you&#8217;ve heard enough.</p>
<p>But we &#8212; that&#8217;s you as the Board, and us as parents &#8212; have a problem: there&#8217;s no decision. The school is still over-populated, and despite having pulled another grade out, there&#8217;s going to be too many students for next year.</p>
<p>So &#8230; what&#8217;s going on? We need an answer. And preferably now, and not at the end of this school year.</p>
<p><span id="more-3392"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve pulled Grade 5 and sent them abroad. (Those students, by the way, are having trouble trying to function in a much bigger school. Big trouble. Ask their parents.) But that&#8217;s not enough. You need to decide the future of French and Spanish at the school. We&#8217;ve already heard that Spanish is likely to be the one to depart. It&#8217;s the youngest of the two programs, after all. (It&#8217;s terrible reasoning, incidentally &#8212; both programs are equally used, according to the Principal.) It needs to live, separately, at a different school.</p>
<p>My problem is that my child is enrolled in Grade 1 Spanish. She quite likes it. I quite like that the school is less than five minutes <em>by foot</em> from our home in Westgate. It&#8217;s effectively our community school, even though it&#8217;s really not, since it&#8217;s a language school first. So if Spanish leaves &#8230; where does my child go?</p>
<p>Did I mention she&#8217;s in Grade 1? I&#8217;m not a big fan of bussing her somewhere, even less considering driving her. Yes, I know <em>kindergarten</em> students are currently bussed &#8212; I don&#8217;t agree with that, either. Maybe I&#8217;m old school (pardon the pun), but I believe schools should be walked to, not driven.</p>
<p>Okay, rant aside, we still have to contend with <em>where</em>. In all the discussions that have been had to date, the schools mentioned are quite a way beyond Westgate. One of them, <a href="http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b103/">Jennie Elliott Elementary School</a>, is in Lakeview, a minimum 7.7 kilometre drive. I know that doesn&#8217;t sound like much to you, but for someone who has been a mere 350 <em>metres</em> away, it&#8217;s a significant change.</p>
<p>Admittedly, that&#8217;s just us. We know that we&#8217;re in the minority &#8212; most kids are shipped into Westgate everyday, and in the end, the percentage of bussed/driven students vs. walking distance would probably remain somewhat similar.</p>
<p>What won&#8217;t remain the same is the effort and time taken to get students somewhere. Let&#8217;s go back to that change in distance: about 8 kilometres between the two schools. Why is this significant? Because bus routes will have to change, and parents driving their kids will have to change. Going in and out of Lakeview isn&#8217;t particularly easy during rush hour (Westgate, we know, is bad enough). You&#8217;re diverting people even further (we know a large proportion comes from &#8220;up the hill&#8221; to the west of Sarcee), and incurring more time.</p>
<p>How about we suggest something different? There&#8217;s a highly unused school barely a kilometre away that could easily accommodate the change: <a href="http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b133/">Rosscarrock Elementary</a>. It&#8217;s very underpopulated. So much so that a large portion of that school is used by Chinook Learning Services, presumably to fill the otherwise unused space. (We know this because our youngest child attends a preschool there, presumably also in unused space.) And at barely a kilometre difference from Westgate Elementary, you&#8217;re not asking for huge changes in how people move around &#8212; it&#8217;s only an extra couple of minutes to drive there, and access to Rosscarrock is marginally better.</p>
<p>So, can I suggest you consider Rosscarrock for the new home for Spanish? For the parents at large, and for the kids who have to travel by bus, this is a far more sane option than asking them to trek further into Lakeview. And if, as your plans last year suggested, that Spanish kids would eventually flow to A.E. Cross, Rosscarrock is a closer school, again reducing the distance delta.</p>
<p>No matter what your final decision, we would like to know <em>soon</em>. We&#8217;ve been waiting a long time for a decision, because &#8212; believe it or not &#8212; it does affect how we plan our lives. We know planning things like this is hard, and that no matter what you do, you&#8217;ll be heavily criticized for it. That&#8217;s just the nature of providing a service like this. But make the decision, and allow us to start adapting soon. Because if it doesn&#8217;t go in our favour, adapting could take quite a long time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration,</p>
<p>A loving and concerned parent</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Nest,</p>
<p>Yesterday, you launched your new Protect smoke detector product. Pretty much my entire social feed is filled with people lusting over the device, especially those &#8212; like me &#8212; who already have enjoyed the Learning Thermostat and want the amazing experience that comes with a Nest product.</p>
<p>You have another experience beyond your products that also receives massive accolades, and rightly so: your <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2012/12/the-nest-excellence-in-product-design-and-customer-service/" target="_blank">product support</a>. From what I understand, you&#8217;re about to do it a terrible disservice.</p>
<p><span id="more-3390"></span> I recently had to do some minor home repair that required me to remove my Nest from the wall. When I reattached it, I had thought that I&#8217;d properly rewired it &#8230; lo and behold, things were not acting quite as they had before. After some futzing around, I decided to call for help.</p>
<p>Normally, I don&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;m one of those people who don&#8217;t read manuals, who love figuring things out for themselves. (I don&#8217;t even ask for directions if I happen to get lost.) That alone should give you an idea of how <em>willing and happy</em> I am to call someone else.</p>
<p>Nest&#8217;s support amazed me when I first called last December. Your representative stayed with me, ever so patiently, for over an hour as we worked through my somewhat odd heating system. Eventually, the unit was working and we were on our way to intelligent heating.</p>
<p>The experience I just had &#8212; over nine months later &#8212; was, dare I say, even <em>better</em>. Not only did the representative (a different one, I should add) quickly get my unit working again, he helped figure out a problem that had dogged me since first installing the unit &#8212; the fan on my furnace never fully shut off. It&#8217;s a variable speed fan. Which the Nest officially supports, I know, but it never seemed to work properly. Yet, despite not knowing how my heating system works, he &#8212; patiently &#8212; worked me through tracing a <em>bad wiring job</em> that led to the Nest being confused by voltage. And suddenly &#8212; fan control. You have no idea how happy this makes me.</p>
<p>Then, after receiving my high praise, he told me that he was not long for his job, because you&#8217;re outsourcing support somewhere else. To be very honest, that made me sad.</p>
<p>It made me sad not for your representative &#8212; I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll land on his feet elsewhere &#8212; but for your future customers who will not receive the same level of attention, and for the <em>inevitable</em> impact on your company&#8217;s reputation. Because no matter how well you&#8217;ve been sold on the idea, or given metrics on cost savings, or promises that there will be no change to Nest&#8217;s support capability, your company is going to suffer for this decision.</p>
<p>And lest you think this is just an armchair plea, please understand that I do know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done the outsourcing/offshore thing. I&#8217;ve been at the other end. And I know the difficulties that will be posed by moving a <em>Canadian/American</em> service to anywhere else on the planet. And yes, I mean &#8220;anywhere&#8221;. Because if it&#8217;s not in either Canada or the United States, it will always fail expectations.</p>
<p>Americans &#8212; and Canadians, whether or not we Canucks want to acknowledge it &#8212; are arrogant, brash, demanding, and impatient. We&#8217;ve become this way over decades, pushing ourselves to bend and break rules (not to mention a few laws) in the interests of getting business done as quickly (and supposedly as efficiently) as possible to benefit our companies&#8217; bottom lines. Within the confines of these two countries, such behaviour is tolerated (if not accepted and even encouraged).</p>
<p>Outside of our little island of hostility, that&#8217;s a different matter. The rest of the world operates on a different schedule, and businesses &#8212; even those ostensibly run as extensions of American/Canadian companies &#8212; operate differently. They operate by local culture, and most other cultures tend to be less uptight than we are.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a criticism of other cultures, incidentally &#8212; that&#8217;s a direct criticism of Americans and Canadians. It is <em>we</em> who are the problem in this equation. The people who will be answering your phones will not be Canadian or American. They will not understand the urgency or impatience that Americans and Canadians express when they call for help. We want answers <em>now</em>, and we want someone we can relate to. It&#8217;s that latter one you&#8217;re going to have problems with, because we don&#8217;t really relate to anyone but ourselves. Heaven help the poor soul who isn&#8217;t already a metre in the air when we say &#8220;jump&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let me give you a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was talking with Akamai (for those of you unaware, a company that helps distribute content over the internet). We were working with the account person from California, who understood our need to get a service up and running as quickly as possible. He very eager shortcut process and side-stepped policy, with verbal agreement that we would follow up immediately with written authorization, to get us what we needed.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, our account was transferred to a different representative, based out of India. Suddenly, all the flexibility we had become used to had vanished; the Indian group played by a different set of rules &#8212; rules that are common in India &#8212; because they weren&#8217;t familiar with how Americans and Canadians behave. I, being a typical brute, was unpleasant. (I would not learn my lesson until two years later&#8230;)</p>
<p>Another one. When you&#8217;re working in IT, you often have to call large vendors to deal with licensing problems, or because a certain piece of software is misbehaving. This particular example is with Adobe. If you live in either the United States or Canada (and possibly other countries, but I couldn&#8217;t find out for certain), you&#8217;ll get an offshore support representative. And it&#8217;s frustrating.</p>
<p>I know this, having had many conversations with people setting up or maintaining offshore support services when I lived in Costa Rica. Short version: those people do not work for Adobe, or AT&amp;T, or Bell, or whomever is contracting the service. They receive access to libraries of information, and have to work through scripts to find answers &#8212; they don&#8217;t have the hands-on knowledge that <em>real</em> support delivers.</p>
<p>Irony: If you live in Costa Rica and call Adobe support &#8212; which I had to &#8212; you&#8217;ll get someone in the United States. Which, when I heard the voice, left me stunned (I half-expected to get one of the various call centres near the company I was working at). Apparently, you could actually get American support staff when you weren&#8217;t in America, and I&#8217;ll tell you: it really helped me understand the difference.</p>
<p>These days, I deal a lot with Rackspace, a hosting vendor based out of Austin, Texas. They maintain a large support base in Austin, whom I&#8217;ve spoken with many times (we do a lot of server work; when you do enough of a thing, you&#8217;ll eventually run into trouble). I chat with them online, over the phone, and through email &#8212; and in all cases (I think; I have actually checked several times), I&#8217;m dealing with someone who understands pressures and demands, and is amiable to the personalities of Canadians/Americans.</p>
<p>This is the problem you&#8217;re going to face, Nest &#8212; making support work for your American/Canadian customer base. I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;re the only ones who can do support, nor do I suggest we&#8217;re the best, but we are most certainly the loudest and most caustic to when support doesn&#8217;t meet expectation.</p>
<p>Something to consider,</p>
<p>One of your current (and likely repeat) customers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago from about now, I had come home, a newly-minted father, without the slightest clue what you were about to do to my life, Monkey. I had no idea what awaited me, not a hint of what things you would make me learn or the things you would teach me. I had no idea how much more I would value life, how I would see things differently, and how I would relate to the world around me.</p>
<p>Six years later, I cannot imagine my life without you. I have trouble even remembering you now as a baby, or the little toddler who simultaneous loved and could barely stand eating ice cream. Because who you are today seems so far from the tiny child you were.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Monkey.</p>
<p><span id="more-3387"></span>I left early this morning. The last two months have been been hard on me, with a lot of early mornings going to work, and late evenings trying to keep my head above water. The summer seems to have slipped through my fingers, and I feel like I&#8217;ve barely had time to enjoy it with you. Today, sadly, was no different, with me trying to get as many of the things on my plate tied off so I can spend a week with you. But it meant I had to work on your birthday, which I really didn&#8217;t want to do.</p>
<p>Mommy has converted me. Since my mid-20s, I had thought little of my birthday. I had thrown myself a couple of nice parties over the years, but the celebratory nature always seemed too forced, and it&#8217;s hard to get everyone excited. Not long after we started dating, Mommy started pushing me to taking birthdays off &#8212; hers and mine. When you were born, it naturally included my children, too. And for the last few years, I&#8217;ve done just that. Until this year &#8212; I had to work my birthday, and sadly, most of yours.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t apologise any harder than I have today, Monkey. But somehow, I think you understood. We cuddled on the front steps for nearly an hour, and you seemed absolutely happy. It might have been the happiest moment of my summer.</p>
<p>You chose dinner, which was at Montana&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t know what you see in that place, though I do understand the appeal today &#8212; you got to wear the moose antlers while the staff sung you a song. The food is terrible, the service sub-standard, but if it puts a smile on your face, I&#8217;ll happily bring you there again.</p>
<p>Grandma met us at home not long after we returned, and you opened your presents (including your brand-new ukelele), had your freshly-made birthday cake, we read stories, and you played a while. Then you played me a song you made up on the ukelele &#8212; a cowgirl tune, you said, as you tapped your fingers on the ukelele&#8217;s body to mimic the horse hooves &#8212; which made me realise that you may have the musical talent I&#8217;ve longed for throughout my life. I guess time will tell.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in bed now, dreaming of making music, and seeing Grandpa and Granny tomorrow. And I truly hope you had a wonderful birthday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s one of those funny things you sometimes run into as a parent. In one moment, you&#8217;re nearly panicking at the seemingly rapid passage of time, that your tiny infant is suddenly racing around the house, reading books far too advanced for her age, and threatening to debate logical positivism. Then you look down and see that one child is adorably cute and had been so for, also seemingly long, forever.</p>
<p>Today, dear Choo Choo, you turned 3. And while the world seems to be spinning around me beyond my control, you sit there at the centre of the storm, giggling and playing and singing songs and making faces and smiling, smiling, smiling. Oh, how I cannot believe how much happier my life is when I get a big hug from you.</p>
<p>Like this morning, when you got up&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3242"></span>It wasn&#8217;t the greatest of mornings, sadly &#8212; your sister, Monkey, was having trouble getting moving. It was a struggle to get her to school on time, and even that didn&#8217;t go particularly well (her water bottle leaked, soaking her snow pants, which then froze). Things were better when I got home, and got a big hug from you.</p>
<p>Then you, Mommy, and I hopped in the car to go get your birthday presents. We decided to try something a little different this year, and let you choose what you got. So we headed over to Market Mall, where you played for a bit in the play area, and then marvelled at all the toys at the Toys &#8216;R Us.</p>
<p>And I have to say, kiddo, you were pretty conservative with your choices. When I was a boy, I would have gone bananas in a store like that, and would have tried to clean the place out. You hung onto a teddy bear dressed a Woody from <em>Toy Story</em> for most of the time, passed up on the lightsabres (which was good, we&#8217;d have to buy two and they ain&#8217;t cheap!), fell in love with a <em>My Little Pony</em> set and a Duplo set with Ariel, and a pair of sunglasses (which you needed, anyway). Mommy added in a Richard Scarry boardgame with airplanes (you&#8217;ve been wanting an airplane since before Christmas). And, finally, you gave up the teddy bear (why, I&#8217;m still not sure) for a Bubble Guppies stuffie.</p>
<p>As Mommy handled the transaction, you hugged your new stuffie tightly, looked at Mommy and I with big wide, eyes, and then gave us each a big hug.</p>
<p>After finding a coffee for mommy (and a hot chocolate for you), I got Monkey from school and Mommy wrapped all of your presents so you could open them later. Then Mommy made a fresh carrot cake and I made dinner while you and Megan played. Then all of us went to go watch Monkey&#8217;s last dance class. You sat on my lap for most of the class. I got lots of big hugs.</p>
<p>After a stop at the library to acquire a few new books, we returned home to find Grandma waiting for us. At first you were terrified of seeing Grandma (I have no idea why), though that quickly subsided and you were ecstatic to be around her again. You played with her until dinner time, and shovelled in your butter chicken, followed by your birthday carrot cake. (A note for next year &#8212; wait until we stop singing before you blow out your candles, okay?)</p>
<p>Present opening and playing came next, which was rapidly ending the day &#8212; both you and Monkey were tired, and tensions began to run very thin. Monkey, sadly, was feeling left out because it wasn&#8217;t her birthday, and no-one was paying her as much attention as we were paying to you. It&#8217;s understandable, and I guess I&#8217;m thankful I don&#8217;t remember doing the same to Auntie Cathy.</p>
<p>Finally, we packed you off to bed, where you settled into your warm sheets, your smile just as big as it was when you woke up. You talked about your new toys, and your new books, and were very happy about your new pyjamas. Then, with your turtle on, you lay down for sweet birthday dreams.</p>
<p>Right after you gave me a great, big, awesome hug.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say that when you put enough people in close proximity for long periods of time, their biological rhythms come into synchronicity. People start thinking the same, they pick up each other&#8217;s habits and nervous ticks &#8230; and of course catch each other&#8217;s colds. And &#8230; uh &#8230; we all got terribly, terribly ill and declared to everyone that we weren&#8217;t able to work for the day. Planned a couple of weeks in advance. In unison.</p>
<p>Okay, yes, we all played hookie. We had a good reason. We&#8217;re helping out <a href="http://banffnorquay.com/">Mt. Norquay</a> with some of their marketing needs. And who are we to pass up an opportunity to experience our client&#8217;s business while taking a much-needed day off to go skiing?</p>
<p>Though &#8230; is it worth mentioning that I haven&#8217;t been near a ski hill in about 25 years?</p>
<p><span id="more-3240"></span>I met Allard just after 7:00 on the east side of 69th St., and from there we went to pick up Bill, followed very shortly after by breakfast for 35 from Tim Horton&#8217;s. Allard&#8217;s declaration to arrive at Canada Olympic Park (now officially known as WinSport), where we met with everyone else, boarded our bus, and hit the road into a foggy morning.</p>
<p>It was the first time I&#8217;d ever turned north off the Trans Canada at Mt. Norquay Road &#8212; I&#8217;d always gone south into Banff Townsite. And a slow, winding route up the side of the mountain brought us to a near-empty parking lot.</p>
<p>This, incidentally, is the reason we went on a Wednesday: mid-week attendance is low (a common problem at ski resorts, so I gather). This allowed us to have a room to ourselves, easy access to the runs (not a single line-up), and gloriously quiet. It also allowed us to get rentals quickly (Norquay does a brilliant job of group events, I have to say). Well, those of us who needed rentals &#8212; there were several people who were already on the hills before I&#8217;d even managed to figure out where the rentals were to be found.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d not worn ski boots in &#8230; well, a long time. The last time I&#8217;d worn them, flipped-up collars were still cool, and neon clothing was considered fashionable. Ski boots, from what I can recall, weren&#8217;t that hard to get on, and I have some vague memory that they were about as tight as a slightly-small pair of ice skates. &#8216;Course, that could be just the fact that I was 15 (do the math, folks) and a lot more supple than I am now. I broke a sweat just trying to get my foot in the first boot. I needed help to get the buckles done up.</p>
<p>We soon found our instructors (there seven of us &#8212; four going for snowboarding, and three of us for skiing), and went off to &#8230; the bunny hill. This was at the bottom of the much-larger hills behind us, the first time that I&#8217;d ever seen &#8220;alpine&#8221; ski runs. They were big. Like, scary big.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I should also mention that I was actually more than a little scared going skiing again. Age aside, I remembered very well that the last time I&#8217;d skied I still had big trouble with control. I couldn&#8217;t turn to the right and my ability to stop was horrid (so bad, in fact, that I&#8217;d had to wipe out to slow down &#8230; I broke the ski, and thankfully not myself). Many years later, on a much bigger hill, I started to wonder if this was such a wise idea&#8230;</p>
<p>Life is not lived if you never try. (Right?) So I joined Eric (who&#8217;d not skiied before) and Kirk (a 25-year snowboard veteran who wanted to try something different) with our Japanese instructor (honestly, it just sounds funny &#8212; she was fantastic), and re-learned what I&#8217;d supposedly learned all those years before.</p>
<p>It took a lot more effort than I thought it would. The hardest part was realizing that the ski was &#8212; shockingly &#8212; <em>slippery</em>. I&#8217;m still amazed that I didn&#8217;t fall over. Thankfully, I took poles, which were helpful, if not a bit of a crutch. They helped me move, and stay stable enough to get on the crazy carpet (basically, a conveyor belt to take us up the bunny hill) and get off at the top.</p>
<p>The hardest part was the stance. You have to stand just so on skis so you can turn and stop yourself. Or, as is my history, lose control and careen into Very Bad Things™. And there are a lot more trees on Mount Norquay than there are on the hills in Ontario, lemme tell ya.</p>
<p>After about five passes on the bunny hill, Kirk graduated to the real hill, while Eric and I kept doing bunny hill runs. Both Eric and I had trouble with control on our turns, and setting us loose on a much steeper hill was begging for trouble without a bit more confidence. But three more passes, and two more with our instructor, and we were on the chairlift heading our way up.</p>
<p>Was I worried? Yeah, maybe a little. But not remotely as much as when I&#8217;d gotten off the bus a couple of hours earlier. Our instructor had done a brilliant job setting us up for the basics. And we had a couple of minutes of discussion before we got to the top. And then we looked down.</p>
<p>Man, that hill looks a lot steeper when you&#8217;re at the top.</p>
<p>And away we went. Slowly, turning (and avoiding other, much faster skiers), we started down. I went side-to-side on the track (easily 25 metres wide), turning in a path that would almost look like parallel lines connected with (very rough) semi-circles all the way down. The instructor and Eric followed soon after. We went back up.</p>
<p>By this point, my feet were in agony. The boots were too tight, and my feet not accustomed to that sort of equipment. I was looking forward to getting out of them.</p>
<p>My next run, I found myself going straighter. And I don&#8217;t mean in terms of side-to-side straightness, I mean more &#8220;straight down&#8221;. My nice, parallel lines had become noticeably angled. About half-way down, the instructor had stopped to wait for us. She waved me on. At the bottom, Eric and Kirk suggested that I have a &#8220;problem with speed&#8221;. To which they were utterly correct &#8212; I do, which is how I got into so much trouble the last time I went skiing.</p>
<p>So of course, on our last run, I went even faster. (Idiot.) We went down a different run &#8212; on the other side of the bunny hill &#8212; which was slightly steeper. And my slightly-foggy goggles didn&#8217;t notice the drop. And I lost control. And let my pole stick into the snow. And I kind dropped my chin onto the top of said pole.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. Honestly. I lucked out in ways I still can&#8217;t comprehend. I should&#8217;ve had, like, an injury or something. But instead it was more of a wake-up call to SLOW DOWN a bit, and take it easier. Which I did, all the way back down to the rental office to drop most of my equipment off.</p>
<p>Getting the boots off? Almost as hard as getting them on, and infinitely more comfortable.</p>
<p>Over lunch we all discussed our various exploits. Jim had managed to find powder somewhere off in the corners. Others had done runs down the moguls (which we could see from our room in the chalet, and it looked positively terrifying from my perspective), while others had gone over on other hills. Colin was the sole non-skier, and had spent his morning on the snow tubes, which was my destination after lunch.</p>
<p>The tubes were built at the end of the mogul run, and were six long slides on which you&#8217;d ride innertubes (well, commercialized versions with handles and a full bottom). You had to haul said innertube to the top of the runs (the crazy carpet was without power for some reason), which was a much harder climb than any of us were willing to believe &#8212; I was winded by the time I got to the top. But the trip down was worth it.</p>
<p>Peita and her family (who&#8217;d snuck up separately) were there as well, and they made a few runs before heading home. Marek joined us for two runs before he declared it &#8220;too much work&#8221; and headed back to skiing. Eric, like myself, had abandoned skiing and found the slides a blast. Colin also returned for a few runs before the two of us opted for a drink at the nearby patio.</p>
<p>We sat in plastic Muskoka/Adirondack chairs and watched as people screamed down the tube slides. Screaming aside, it was a nice day to sit back and relax a bit &#8212; something both of us admitted was difficult to do at home. Then Colin noticed the chairlift next to the patio &#8230; people were getting off, sans skis, at the bottom. He immediately declared that we needed to go up.</p>
<p>The chairlift brought us up to Norquay&#8217;s old tea house, which is the highest point at the resort. It&#8217;s a gorgeous view from up there, even if it was snowing, reducing our visibility. (I imagine the top of Sulphur Mountain is better, if only because it&#8217;s at the very top of the mountain, whereas the tea house is only on the east slope.) It was very peaceful up there.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2013/03/evans-hunt-sick-day-2013/snowing/' title='Snowing'><img width="300" height="224" src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Snowing-300x224.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignnone wp-image-3381" alt="Snowing" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/8540116478/">Geoff S.</a></p>
<p>We got back to the chalet just after 3:00, and remained there until it was time to go. We piled onto the bus and headed into Banff for dinner at the Elk and Oarsman. We dominated the back room, and likely the entire bar&#8217;s volume level to boot.</p>
<p>Then it was back on the bus for our return to Calgary, watching <em>Big Trouble In Little China</em>. The driver got us back in what seemed to us a record time. Something, I think, we all preferred. I was home just after 9:00, and attempted to write this blog entry. I fell asleep from exhaustion, barely a paragraph in.</p>
<p>All said and done, it was  a brilliant day. And, thankfully, injury-free. Two days later, I&#8217;m still a bit sore (shovelling snow the morning after was much harder than usual), though nothing terrible. But I do have one small problem.</p>
<p>I think I like skiing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2013/02/a-perfect-gluten-free-bread-loaf/a-perfect-wheatless-bread/' title='A perfect wheatless bread'><img width="300" height="224" src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-perfect-wheatless-bread-300x224.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignnone wp-image-3378" alt="A perfect wheatless bread" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/8503677005/">Geoff S.</a></p>
<p>For our wedding, Alex and I got a breadmaker. (I think we had it on our list.) It&#8217;s a good breadmaker, and we&#8217;ve used it many, many times, though we had eventually stopped using it for the baking aspect &#8212; the loaf size was odd, and if you forgot to take the paddle out, the hole in the bottom was annoying.</p>
<p>Then, about a year ago, Alex started an elimination diet that eliminated wheat from her plate. Thus began the long (and not-infrequently bad-tasting) search for something to replace the gluten (and thus, wheat) that had been removed. That meant finding a different way to make bread.</p>
<p>It was much harder than I thought.</p>
<p><span id="more-3239"></span>There&#8217;s a lot of wheatless bread recipes out there, and I think (at some point) we went through nearly all of them. Many were dense and gooey, some had a terrible aftertaste, and there were a couple that I never even tasted &#8212; they just went in the garbage.</p>
<p>But, finally, nearly a year later, we&#8217;ve found something that produces what we consider to be one of the best loaves we&#8217;ve had since starting this search. And since I know there&#8217;s people out there in similar circumstances, the least we could do is share our discovery with you.</p>
<p>Now, point of note: this uses <strong>eggs</strong> and <strong>almond flour</strong>. If you are avoiding either of these, you&#8217;re going to have to keep looking. We&#8217;ve done the egg replacer thing, too, and  &#8230; well, frankly, it doesn&#8217;t work the same. Not remotely. And the almond flour seems to impart a few properties that rice flour on its own can&#8217;t bring to the table. (At least, this has been our experience. Your mileage may vary.)</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re doing this sort of thing, we really recommend a flour mix that seems to be a solid &#8220;all purpose&#8221; gluten-free flour. It&#8217;s a 1:1:1 combination of white rice flour (water absorbency), brown rice flour (more of a glutenous texture), and almond flour/meal (taste, and really helps with the browning). We keep a large canister of this stuff handy for bread, cookies, pancakes, and so forth.</p>
<p>Okay, so on with the recipe! You&#8217;ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">2 cups of the &#8220;all purpose&#8221; flour (see above)</span></li>
<li>1 cup potato starch (this seems to be the magic for keeping the rise)</li>
<li>1/2 cup tapioca flour/starch (depending on what the label says; they&#8217;re the same thing)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons xanthan gum (very important, this &#8212; do not skimp, here!)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry bread yeast</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar (we use coconut sugar, which works beautifully)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cup of hot water (yes, hot)</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>3 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mixer with a large bowl (we use a Kitchenaid, which is perfect; a breakmaker may work for this, but we haven&#8217;t tried), add in the salt, sugar, vinegar, and hot water. Get the mixer going at about 40% speed, and make sure all the salt and sugar are dissolved. Then add the eggs, while the mixer is still going. It should froth a little.</p>
<p>While your wet is mixing, combine the flours and yeast. Once the wet has been mixing for a couple of minutes (so it&#8217;s <em>well</em>-mixed), turn the mixer off, add the flour, and resume mixing at about 20% speed. It&#8217;ll thicken pretty quickly, and look a little like a thick hummus. Let it mix for a couple of minutes, then stop and scrape down the dough that&#8217;s stuck to the sides and on the paddle (which, if yours is like ours, it&#8217;ll collect in a bit of a ball). You&#8217;ll want to do this twice, just to be certain.</p>
<p>While the dough is mixing, turn your oven on to its lowest possible setting. Most ovens seem to go no lower than 170 F/76.6 C. This is to help your dough rise. You get one shot at this (gluten-free breads can&#8217;t do multiple rises), so it&#8217;s important that your oven be warm.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s all mixed, scrape (you&#8217;ll need to, trust me) the dough into a bread pan (we use a silicone one which is fantastic, and requires no greasing). Try to smooth the top out as much as you can &#8212; any peaks will be make their way through the final bake.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the catch with the oven &#8212; yeast will die above about 104 F/40 C. So <em>before</em> popping your loaf into the oven, <strong>turn the oven off</strong> (trust me, this is important), and open the door for about a minute to let out the excess heat (relax, your oven will retain quite a bit of its latent heat). Insert ye olde pan and dough, close the door, and don&#8217;t you dare think of opening it again until it&#8217;s all done, hear me?</p>
<p>Set a timer for 30 minutes. Walk away.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes have elapsed, you&#8217;ll note that the bread only looks a little risen. Don&#8217;t panic. Turn your oven back on using its lowest setting (i.e. &#8220;Keep Warm&#8221;). Set the timer, another 30 minutes, and walk away again. When you come back, you&#8217;ll find (don&#8217;t open the door!) that it&#8217;s risen considerably.</p>
<p>Now set your oven to 350 F/176.6 C. If your oven can change temperatures fairly quickly, set your timer to about 50 minutes; if yours is slower (like mine), set it for 60. Again, walk away&#8230;</p>
<p>After the final timer goes off, make sure you get that loaf on a cooling rack as quickly as possible &#8212; there&#8217;s still quite a bit of moisture in that bread, and it&#8217;ll turn the bread to mush if you leave it in the pan. Also, you might want to turn the loaf on its side, as I&#8217;ve found it keeps it from sinking. Let it rest for at least an hour before cutting &#8212; you need to give it time to firm up.</p>
<p>So, yes, it&#8217;s a bit complicated but the results are worth it. You don&#8217;t need to freeze it (unlike some other gluten-free breads), and if you keep it in an airtight container, it&#8217;s good for almost a week, and maybe more &#8230; but we always eat it before then.</p>
